1," do you want these"
1," I have to bake"
1," so where we're sitting right now used to be Dawson airport Robert Mueller airport to ever fly and no I only picked someone up here one"
1," close in"
1," 1200s June 99 I think someone who was on the final flight that landed. Mueller."
1," it's just weird. I like there's like a flight that took off somewhere and Austin might not the older for the new airport as we are 43 years ago"
1," screwed over by 2008/2009 for a really long time like they built the Home Depot in the Best Buy everything"
1," coffee right over here across the road there's a healthy on here because housing on YouTube you downtown"
1," behind I still have any concept or did he just still coughing"
1," with a healthy on a rutamaya a couple of times"
1," I would never make the track down there like in my mind if I wanted coffee I wouldn't go downtown or if I was downtown it would like late at night and I was getting drunk like I was just in my mind never make sense to"
1," worked downtown between 2000 and"
1," number 2020"
1," digest"
1," you are"
1," if"
1," whatever"
1," couldn't open the"
1," most like modern-day age problem I've ever heard the air right now that would be like Kramer's only talk only talk to people if they showed up to be there"
1," not"
1," completely different anymore"
1," and I was pissed off that I was having to sit in traffic and I will try to in my mind I was trying to wrap my head around how much work traffic has gotten moved here and I looked it up and the population of Austin proper has doubled between the year 2000 and the year 2020 that's crazy"
1," or we can go to"
1," oceans are"
1," available"
1," I think it's still there but I think they put like a bar"
1," so it's long gone it's been a couple different bars"
1," I see it in the store is only reason for the"
1," so we're just going to shake our fists at the microphone to enter the city in general and yell at it to get off our Lawn isn't just that I'm getting here"
1," a car we got coffee at the house."
1," we just got every kind of coffee maybe we should have got flight passed right by the airport before I go there for iced coffee cold"
1," not in the coffee shop across the street there's like a big man made lake here believe it or not they didn't have this like when painful after I looked it up before I came over this morning to record the old Runway was runaway 13 or 31 which means it was like 13 degrees"
1," so would have been 130Â° it would have gone Northwest so we would have seen planes coming in from this important you guys the audio book The Runaway would have been a more or less where we are right now yeah I'll try to figure out the stages and I think the runway came this way I think we would have been right in the middle of in the old Power Wheel control tower it so it over behind the houses in the Mueller sub development Jackson you know what you were driving down 35 very often points would come in really low and land right over you like you felt like you could reach out to your car and touch the plate and it was so alike about the"
1," studios"
1," like they're like another like like in Ohio or something and they're like a weirder than you like an awesome"
1," in the"
1," you don't see that because there's no wait or any safer to say if you go to get there was another Lake anywhere around here I don't know"
1," how long"
1," to build the lake and then they have to stock it with fear all over the"
1," take us to the water to keep it all over there and everywhere we've been under a boil water notice the past few days in Austin so it's been really limited I asked you where you can go to get coffee shop in a little coffee star I've been making it a home in different making it home but you're going somewhere luckily there's one place not too far from our"
1," show called epic or epoxy box for some reason whenever I think we have a deal with the airport or they'll boil the water for them and you talk and keep making calls going to"
1," know if I have a favorite know I wouldn't but not because of their bad because I've never thought about it it's not like a hamburger I can't think of it off the top of my"
1," for sunglasses"
1," different"
1," profile so it a burr grinder or conical grinder"
1," has an Aeropress"
1," that there's no way to detail a cigarette so"
1," over by like the peacock room at"

1," almost 10 years old like spilled liquor"
1," our mutual friends they tearing down that block at like 4th and Colorado where are the most recently that restaurant Lonesome Dove was but that's where right next to that was for the original Draft House was"
1," open back in like"
1," to be right next to"
1," it was a really small City theater with no resort fees so if you wanted to see what they were playing that night you have to show up to the box office like 3 or 4 hours before the movie or go there and you would have to stand in line in order to get"
1," Albert I went to the Traphouse no I don't"
1," so yeah"
1," when I went to college for a year and one of the people who live next to me was the sister-in-law of Tim Tim Tim"
1," are Terry Lee Chester movie theater in Austin going to be called the Drafthouse I can do all the stuff that's how I found out about I was looking at the time and I was like oh yeah my old neighbor had this is like her"
1," it was just like oh my friends in laws and opened up this place like I'm going to go check it out"
1," a lot of that stuff started going to have one here to get you started that creeping out and it's like slowly you know what over across the country from there"
1," and I was like man I wouldn't eat there in Austin"
1," trailers trailers a trailer behind Star Bar right now right or was it a"
1," you know your supply company that gave them everything they needed but as you grow and expand any bigger suppliers and Supply more stuff for the quality changes affect the growth"
1," anymore I don't know if you remember that place will you have an office if you do a long time ago they got silly eyes are getting rotated by people you can get a chicken fried steak covered in case so instead of gravy"
1," or Home Depot in Buda the Home Depot open"
1," would make a Philly cheesesteak but until you think normal like ribeye or whatever they would use barbecue brisket"
1," know"
1," forgot about"
1," at work I love that unexpected I also want that like that Spirit of oil business"
1," sandwich 20-25 minutes to"
1," and it's not very many people living in that town so there's like the market was really small"

1," that was a no one like you walked in on Monday Monday with meatloaf or whatever it was just one thing and if you wanted that that's okay"
1," lived three works in the only apartment complex which had to build buildings and we would walk across the train tracks to Main Street I've asked her like always been"
1," look up silly what's on the left or to the right of that and it just to the right of that was too much"
1," audio 10 hours"
1," huge compared to body spare"
1," at least you were completely"
1," article"
1," came out"
1," travel to more than you"
1," screamed and he's like oh my God it was fine it was as she looked at"
1," screamed I'm still covered her breasts are growing"
1," running for 10 yd or 14 years now at this point podcast we were already in the Congress office a lot of this stuff like that all the beauty stories predated about it but never really talked about it"
1," cuz I know where"
1," we had so many people who we even worked with internally at the company's us to try to not do that turns through audience 5000 hours 650 episodes now 15:00 a podcast to get caught up on every single"
1," to try to remember when we first met Eric I try to place it down and I I guess I feel like you're like Kodak always been there"
1," we were in the back by the comic book rainbow comic book"
1," for motion clip can you remember the time you laugh hardest in your life and that's the memory"
1," jokes about Mario having a gun"
1," work under the table to keep the process out of Bernie site so we have to work to get him"
1," first day"
1," here and"
1," turn"
1," bet on that"
1," we've known him way way longer than project about anybody else and we spent more time in a room with him and it's just a side effect of"
1," couch to put in a production room so that if three of us were in the room two people can work in one person could take a nap and then the person who took a nap to come up and work and work and work and go and take a nap likes Wicked I'll trade out taking a nap because there wasn't enough time to go home and sleep on that couch. We we could work as much as possible I"
1," was on top of like a commentary and all that is"
1," impossible to overstate the amount of work that went in on you know it's early internet time it seems like an early learning so much like not being able to like Google stuff for the only people doing that we're like big mega-corporation everything was a hacked we did I mean we learned so much like I to this day I hate DVD"
1," players with a passion that we learned every DVD player has different Logic for how it handles a disc you had to test we weren't attempting to get except talking about and we have to test it"
1," how many different DVD players we could and find a bug that all this one particular DVD player doesn't like that we need to read off of the entire thing one brand of a cheap DVD player sdvd and will not play at we need to make a new version and exchange anybody who has a problem like a swap out there to"
1," I'm going to circle back now. One of the proudest moment I have to go take that week that we hate when we had our first screen that project at the Drafthouse"
1," location of milk on down on Colorado Street and we have different versions of season one so we know we have the actual version had released the movie version and then for like Festival of their screams like a 60 minutes to talk I'll just try to like a compact it in. If I don't have any made up that was really cool to go from you like being a fan and going to the Draft House to watch things that I love that Grandma that may go to like Night of the Living Dead screamed like she was never a new release movie it was like something iconic something that you love for whatever reason to even be on the other side until I be standing in front of the crowd at the screen and you to sit down we are never going to talk to the absolute coolest I will never forget that and then we did not tell you"
1," I don't remember if we will go to the original"
1," moment"
1," turn down and totally gone now it's going down into it in the programming and like I mean I saw the jerk there and make her day one pizza in a cup you know if that was special to me and maybe our generation like movies that influence us and our sensibilities"
1," it cuz you couldn't"
1," don't"
1," good news right man"
1," yeah well I"
1," didn't come out here to film or record something that we're not really sure"
1," do you think final thoughts on how"
1," if I"
1," it's a great opportunity to build social engagements where we figure out where we should go to leave it up to the audience"
1," you can follow us at"
1," and I'll do what you want to do you say goodbye goodbye"
1,"is a Rooster Teeth production"
1," I got these glasses because of a TV show that I liked and Catch Fire and an Amber to you."
1," It was hot and Catch Fire I didn't but you and Bernie both told me desperately though I need to watch three or four seasons not very long at all was on AMC the show initially if this sounds like the nerdy show ever but it's like such a character-driven show that it doesn't matter like I'm all the nurses up there too so just window-dressing it's all about the people and the first season of the show is about the personal computer Revolution and but it doesn't focus on Silicon Valley companies in Dallas and Austin Austin and then it continues up to Dallas cuz you think about like there were a lot of computer companies back then in the Texas area at the time they were all involved in the early computer Revolution anyway one of the main characters the guy character named Joe McMillan he's played by Lee Pace is a phenomenal actor and I think in the third or fourth season"
1," she gets glasses like these and my wife treated me was like you need glasses like that and she scoured the internet and found the glasses that he wore in the show and bought me those glasses now do you think it's because your wife is super attracted to that dude answer lawn and she wants to dream bang him while she's sleeping with you but that's good company has a good looking fantastic show and I think it we hear a lot of stories about like a revolution the internet Revolution and a lot of it focuses on California yeah I thought was interesting because a lot of the Texas Tech get forgotten and of course the fictitious company in like it is like but it's in the circles of companies that actually did existence and events that actually did transport sorry, but I feel like I said it's very character focused. I think it's a it's a really really good show on Netflix"
1," believe you I'm just saying from their sentence from their perspective and makes no sense but"
1," America to America Arizona BBC America"
1," it's a great show and I that's why I know it airs on BBC America in my favorites on my TV"
1," America is trying to back you up my man"
1," I don't doubt that if I"
1," if you that first run new episodes on BBC America let me ask you this American catch fire on BBC America"
1,"today's top hits"
1," we're going. Even though it's not raining today"

1," oh my God for coffee"
1," oh my God okay so did we"
1," recorded a year ago I can't remember we didn't come to any conclusion"
1," but then you you pull the"
1," open truck so it's been a slow transition if my names written I try to have it written as we stopped and if I meet new people I introduced myself as best I don't use myself as Gus anymore this is a pain in the ass for you but there are people in my life who do not know me as Gus there are people who I've met who only know me as Gustavo"
1," now don't wear them it's not weird for you it's weird because you before because I've known you most of your life feels like"
1," or my name it's like why should I go by and I like my name and then just go by my actual name. It was a better than the just let me ask"
1," was born a Jeffrey by the way"
1," loved it was awesome people stole your name so much"
1," like I like it when we went to see"

1," you in some way but I just said absolutely but you owe anything in America you cannot escape from it's a crushing financial burden in"
1," luck when you go to buy think we're finally off for upper under like that with a G or a j like a"
1," I really did have a dream like you said in the first episode which you could you listen to just last week and we talked about the name and I think that it's infected my subconscious nothing I was really stressed about trying to come up with a name for the podcast and if I think I was thinking about it so much that it started dreaming about it and in my dream the podcast was already out like we've been doing it for a while and like I just saw"
1," it typed out I saw the name of our podcast and that we weren't saying it but it was like it was on a piece of paper or like on a computer screen like it was marketing material for it and was a MMA podcast and that. That's all I told you but in my dream I didn't know what that stood for and it was a reason it was called that that part I didn't tell you until now because we already have a local if we can't change it can I guess asterisk okay dreams don't make sense okay so like you're trying to come up with the rational thing that it means dreams r g a"
1," never mattered anyway or maybe"
1," I'd like what you doing I know I don't want to say what it was in my dream cuz I want people who listen to this podcast to come up with what a m m a means for them my small wife"

1," that is the first thing we ever did it is very first Emmy was a"
1," 2004 I was thinking of one that was a couple of months later in August of 2004 which was when we went to Melbourne Australia which was our first international trip and that was interesting because that was I think our first I would I would say like a fan meet-up or like a community be done because we did this event in the theater and then when the event the theater was done we were just like Hey we're going to go to a bar and drink if anybody wants to come with us you're more than welcome to and we didn't even go to like a third like SF another location we went to the bar in our hotel what hotel we were staying at and just come to the bar and drink and we just drank would like 30 people who showed up at our hotel we didn't and play pool"
1," ship broke the electricity in that hotel to the power because of Jeff"
1," it was like I was like free iPhone it was like some little shity Verizon phone and and Jeff bought like that adapter to adapter plugs but it doesn't change the voltage and I was like don't plug that into a bucket of work and you plug it in anyway and there was this really bright spark and a loud noise and all the power in the building went off"
1," do you like scream and you pulled your arm back from the walk all that sucks and we just left the building"
1," the entire trip started off bad on a backflow convention in Jacksonville we were invited"
1," all right yeah I need like will pay for your your plane ticket will pay you will pay for your hotel and when I can fit this a scam so you know just like our pool we're living together at the time so we drive down to the Austin Airport and we get there we go to check in and look at your house."
1," super apologetic and another plane ticket at Lake leaves in a couple of hours so we have to sit in the airport with all of our luggage cuz we can't check the bag cuz we don't have a ticket 30% with all our backs and everything is like in the airport for like an extra 4 hours or wait for the next flight to take us to"
1," nothing but we did one person screaming in January before before that was our only experience that was at the Lincoln Center"
1," but that was I think very different people he was like a theater"
1," people who came specifically to see our thing this was this was a convention this is like a wider audience yeah this was not people who were coming to see your thing just for us that's it"
1," will be there I will fulfill Our obligation and then this is the"
1," in"
1," house I normally that's why we head back to check if you have some"
1," we just like sat in the hallway like literally sat on the floor in the hallway open up a suitcase and I was like who wants a shirt and"
1," seriously and they didn't"
1," minutes do you remember"
1," I want to say it was like a Friday Saturday Sunday event I think our panel all that stuff happened on Saturday if I remember right on Sunday before we went to the hotel we know we were doing like one fast one last final walk around like the event stuff and someone was like oh have you not been in the exhibit hall yet look there's a whole floor people who sell stuff here that's your booth right there were you not in your booth all weekend so we had a space that we could we could be like you told us that we had no idea where I was selling stuff that's how these events"
1," Chicago Comic-Con in 05"
1," that was a nightmare"
1," is it going to hit I want to pretend I didn't know me like telling this story I can act like that was someone else who does not exist in his"
1," it was a Harry Potter movie I don't know which one came out in the summer of 04"
1," I guess I think it's like there were there waiting at the hotel."
1," company I think when we Gator cab. Whenever that when we took the cab there I took a card from the drive yet I had the phone number on it when we're done week if there's no cabs at the VA"
1," I would be so stupid we can call this phone number and get a cab to come get us"
1," was she wasn't happy with her she wasn't mean"
1," Jax not like super scary"
1," I'm just I'm"
1," the couch lamp one in the morning sorry I was"
1," longer than we watch the movie it was one of the movie we were half"
1," Interstate and since it was 2004 it's not like we have smartphones we had a vague idea of the direction to the hotel I never been to Jacksonville before flip phone didn't have instructions and I was like it's in that direction about seven miles I don't know specifically"
1," marine or something for the correct if we get to the water will be able to find it and I"
1," something no matter how prepared you thought you were you were still like a stupid human being nothing to help you and I wonder why Uber was able to displace taxi companies are out and we were like it's it's funny because we were at a young enough age where we were dumb do dumb stuff like that in 2000"
1," 2426 I guess I should have been smarter by the time"
1," in the military which I like stunted your growth it's like you're not out and about like you live a very regimented life so I think it's not that it's stunts you it's just that it's not the same as being out in the actual world it's a very different life when I was in high school of applying to West Point and I got pretty far along in the process. It's been a long time I remember right you need to have like letters of recommendation for your Senator and stuff like that I was I was like I was gathering all of that material to send off at my application to West Point and I think I got to the point where I was like do I really want to spend four years in the military after I finish"
1," college and even then like in college like I made all the physical training and all that stuff like to dedicate eight years of my life to this and I was just like anybody like in the back of my cycling you come out of your second like you're you know you it's it's it's not that bad I like I can't do that"
1," graduated high school in 96 so if I did for you to West Point I would have been done in two thousand and I would have been in the military as a second Lieutenant from September 11th 2001 I would be a most likely would have spent the next couple of years in Iraq and Afghanistan"
1," quickly"
1," sing weird coincidence"
1," to look back and think about like all those strange coincidences or seemingly inane small decisions you make in your life that end up having like a ripple effect or bigger effect on the road that you don't think about yeah I think that's one of the things we're focusing on and talking about Miss podcast"
1," be seemingly small decision to move to Austin for there for whatever reason and then seeing the transformation of Austin and in translation of our careers and our jobs just from weird bullshit like you and I will you talk about the call center you and I worked at that call center it was never my intent to work at that call center I will when I first moved to Austin with the awesome back in January 98 I was crashing at a friend's place down off of Riverside and he was a student at UT and he was like I was looking for a job he was going for a job and I was applying everywhere and I could not get hired this is Jim I couldn't get hired anywhere like I would I went to Highland Mall and every single store that had the head like a hiring sign like I applied like a retail whatever I trying to get any job I could said no money no one is hiring me and Joe didn't have a car and he was looking at the daily text in which is the UT newspaper"
1," and there was a help wanted ad for a call center and he was I hate you drive me down to the call center it's just like a little further south and we live like after I drove go down he can apply to this interview at the call center whatever took him back home and then the next day he went off to class at UT and I woke up and I'm like what am I apply for that job I'm looking for a job"
1," so I applied for that job and then like later that day Joe came back from from UT to settle and he walked you did down at the call center and rice and tell him that my phone rings and it's a call center and they like you're hired. Like they just hired"
1," was such a like I don't know I felt weird today she was like totally fine with it whatever was like man I stole that job from Joe yeah"
1," manager"
1," like they did their end so we're walking"
1," do it cost of Jason yeah I was awesome"
1," channel really that's a big bass because I feel like a huge military presence of Air Force bases in San Antonio and"
1," I might"
1," that's why I like all it takes is like one person and then I realized that's an option I guess rightly we"
1," and"
1," that. When I"
1," the"
1," so I feel like there was one place to hide before I call that the the the call center job the only place I could get a job was doing telemarketing whole calling people trying to sell their security systems would you get a hotel it was right behind the hotel over here what is it used to be the red line I don't know what it is I did one day of training they're all like this how you doing you call people give him feel about security systems and then it was actually I left that I left training at that place I went interviewed at the call center and it was that date of the call center called me and gave me the job looks like so I showed up for one day I did training on cold calling people so security system and that was his I never I never went back to them to sell any know it was it was just"
1," here's a scrap this how you do with the telephone system for work like that was I didn't actually make any calls it was just like I deserve someone else to"
1," another one or"
1," really different yeah I keep going"
1," Wyatt"
1," wrap up or keep going it's an audio podcast you know what this is this is this is"
1," poorly your finger in the air I'm not sure which way to go"
1," doing this or this direction do you flip your finger to point up or do you points I'd like some of crazy are you are you ordering around and drinks or you know"
1," I even met yet"

1," hired almost a year before Jeff I got hired in February like the first couple days of February 1998 when I started and I worked there for almost a year before Jeff got hired by the time she got hired I was a so they were different tiers of technicians like when you first get hired your level one technician to take whatever calls then if you do well enough you got promoted to level two technicians where you would wait for the cost of a little ones can fix and he was transferred to you and you would fix it or you do call back so you need an appointment and then if you stuck around long enough you became a manager and you would need a map so I got hired I was at the point where I was making the transition from Louisville to take Misha to team leader and Jeff was a level one technician when he got hired but he worked for a different team leader Brian mischley many things you got eventually transferred to Dave by the time you were level to set the time and date"
1," how are you I remember like when you got hired a crazy or are you were like a phenomenal call-taker like all your times that I like how quickly can you resolve an issue like all of just X didn't make sense like everyone's like is he hanging up on people like is he not resolving these calls like this is like all these numbers are way too good and so Jeff was like a Phenom at the call center"
1," Rolex and retire we realized that was not happy that"

1," want to tell that there should we tell the story about when I want to hear the story about the guy who hired himself out the attempted midnight"
1," but I started in February 98 to call Centre was still really small a typical shift might be three or four people but it's just came on and I don't know specifically what ship was when you start it was probably like 20 people"
1," I'm in my"
1," I was I was like a low double-digit employee over there you know you don't like as far as like hire date and then undergone crazy expansion but by the time you know Jeff is also we're both managers there was the ships have grown quite a bit a lot of turnover in that business you know that we hired a lot of at the time of her like college students work for a while no big deal right this circle of life we try to make the job is easy as possible so that even if someone had no technology could come in and very quickly get up to speed and start taking calls but because of the rapid turnover sometimes it was poor communication the management side so I can show up for the first day be like oh well I don't have your paperwork I don't know what let's get you started in the system you get him going"
1," when days dude showed up"
1," neither of us is working I'm just working and everything else and it wasn't till payrolls get the next payroll was getting run that I think was Bernie was like running the payroll as like he's not in the system we can't pay him because we don't have any of his information"
1," so many weird stories like that without call center and it people we know still to this day and that we worked with her for a long time"
1," How I met Jason I would love to hear it so we know this was a bunch of computers and you know at the night at night time when there were mismatched call volume obviously the shift got smaller so you just going to use sometimes he would go and it had a really fast Mission internet mind you this is a late night he's so sometimes you know at night some of us to go over and we play like Quaker do them or whatever cuz they'll ignore PCS are all on the internet so we would have"
1," quick quick to I think that nights and Jason I believe he lived on campus that you didn't want to drive down to the down to South Austin off of Ben White you do want to drive down there so I can connect from his dorm room at UT and so he just likes are joining our quick two matches and his quick to name was poop poop poopy poopy so I was like who the hell is his poopy guy like no it's Jason he works with us that was his nickname for 10 years and"
1," it's going to get you smoke or I"
1," stop"
1," it's not like the people here didn't know we had the schedule right in front of us we could see the comings and goings so we knew what the call volume is going to be in keep track of the employee the schedule it was on right in front of you the whole"
1," they were talking about employees are and embrace and you ever work with Robert"
1," was not a great employee"
1," a bad employee but he wasn't like a phenomenal employee very smart smart guy but he would show up to work in the morning you know hungover usually a big drinker we always we always we hung out with the guy all the time at night but he would show up to work hungover in the morning and he wouldn't you know he would you with your picture like a cubicle Farm that's where we're all sitting for our our our"
1," I called you from the trash truck by the way"
1," second he wouldn't sit at the cubicle he would sit under it and he was on the floor under the cubicles and the only way you knew Robert was there working is every now and then his hand we come to answer it whenever he was raised under the"
1," Gus 30 pounds lighter than then I am not like I was a skeleton with a giant head he was"
1," place right"
1," of that group"
1," him the people who work there when I started like more like the"
1," I forgot you said it"
1," casinos that time you and I went to casino I was in the middle of a streak where every time I went to casino El Camino Starship Troopers was playing on the TV there it was like six times in a row and I was convinced there was something wrong with me cuz every time I walk in it was always Starship Troopers and was always more or less the same place in the movies like in the training montage were there in the shower and I'm like what the fuck is going on here"
1," just please go for it and feel totally different world and now it's raining by the way the first digital camera I ever saw in my life was at that call center call center bought a digital camera to like take photos I catch Watson employees to attach the profile unlike the intranet that way you can like look up employees see what you're talkin about everything and you could say they were going to use the camera they were going to use it at like 9 a.m. on training days and all the other times it wasn't being used so you can check it out kind of like a library if your employer you could check out this camera until you are home and this camera was so old and used double a batteries and it connected to computer via serial port"
1," if you filled up the internal storage of this camera which is probably only like a hundred megabytes or something and you wanted to transfer the photos we are you still connected to your computer if the camera was filled with photos the battery would die for you to transfer all the photos off of it cuz the connection was so slow when are you in any way you can check it out and you could do you take photos do whatever and then back into the company and what day were all hanging out and Theo came in he like return the camera and he's like all man you like you talk I think I got him a sweetie I'm used to it by this point he's like yeah you know I took it home and the same thing everyone else when they first get digital camera took a picture of my balls"
1," I don't like this long pause around like what you'll see how you know I just got the camera down real low got a little I'm going to be on my couch looks like a huge are you serious you just like tried to pass it off so now it's a lot like everyone does that like you're weird for not taking a picture of your"
1," it's over whenever I think of digital cameras I never really think the field taking a picture of his balls and like and now there's like a cameras everywhere"
1," if I remember right I think early on probably wasn't the first very early on we talked about making content on the internet together yeah because Jeff had already been making a zine"
1," same age when I"
1," and I learn how to host a web servers and I learned book The very technical side of that so then I was like what I want to make contact but I don't know how to act like I do have a very fundamentally make websites I know why you're laughing at 3 websites but I needed someone to work with to help me with that and just knew how to make website as well sounds like we can make websites together and we can make funny stuff on the internet and why are you laughing Jack laughing"
1," go"
1," and there's like a whole page devoted to the Blue Oyster Cult"
1," Blue Oyster Cult fans night because my pedophile computer science teacher with a Blue Oyster Cult"
1," teacher the problem with yeah it was like a math Camp I didn't know how to log into that server I had to like find the people who administered that that computer network down at Texas state was Stella s back then and have them take that website offline"
1," and look for a"
1," I think we are still you know 2022 like working together clever to make you find it much easier now than it was back then but it was part of my life it was such a nice thing back then like oh you want to make stuff and you want to make it online like making stuff online like in the late nineties I put was it the band page the cringey should I made in high school so it's like we wanted to try to make original think that's why we were talking about driving around in the reason we stopped here when was a doctor's office what we're making contact back then we will go to garage sales and we would take photos of stuff we would find then just like invent humorous stories and post it like block style on the internet and there was like a big thing we would do for years trying to find stuff to post online"
1," picture of a car wreck that we saw you at"
1," did you get away with it"
1," time there was a lot of fun and you know it look at back whenever you do get a website town I think at its peak like those stories we would get like 3,000 view the day and who want to like come see what we're doing and that's how I would drag you up out of bed on the Saturday morning we got to make this if you would want to see if you lot of people waiting to see what happens if you were going to do today and that we came up with I don't we talk about the garage sale games we came up with I don't want like people to take this in a bad direction we"
1," advertise in newspapers"
1," like little yard signs you put a sign up garage sale pointing in this direction so we came up with like almost like Gorillaz style garage sales we wanted to make or we wanted like I don't know what you would call it I would think I might be the best descriptor"
1," are we called one surprise garage sale"
1," we would advertise a garage sale and in the dress and not tell the people there and then for 7 a.m. and that we would show up and set up a garage sale in the front yard at 7 a.m. until we had another one we called the Grand Prix where we would go with the"
1," but if we had it worked"
1," also had reverse garage sale where you would show up with your own stuff you were trying to sell it to a garage sale and you would try to sell them something you brought to them like they're trying to sell all their ship but you bring your stuff there I tried to sell it to him"
1," garage sale at that you realize now when we were saying there's a lot of trucks that easily exploitable with hilarious"
1," and you should not be"
1," about garage sales and go in a garage sale for July we started thinking about funny twists to them like the sort of"
1," really like some stuff I want to talk to"
1," we learned a lot I"
1," that's the thing I want to talk about that for a"
1," do like eating plant-based stuff"
1," in your eyes you're looking around like oh no oh no oh no"
1," okay"
1," going to say it"
1," are near an air conditioning unit for an apartment complex that is not going to shut off because it's on seasonably hot for some weird reason"
1," we're out at baths which is like a coffee shop and bakery in East Austin open after I move it did you know back over in that direction if they're not going to"
1," three blocks of each other three"
1," and the reason I lived there is that when I when I was ready to buy a house I did a search in Austin for will you actually told me about this place but I also did a search in Austin for the cheapest house like in Austin proper and that was that house but it was the cheapest house in Austin"
1," three on the East and the north down to Seattle white and it was the cheapest house in Austin it was a tiny house is really really small and it was I want to say I paid $180,000 for it"
1," same house we sold last year for $600,000 I did not sell them for $600,000 / bought it after me then sold it for $600,000 which is just a testament to what a rapid change not only often but it's a microcosm East Austin has experienced where we where we are right now specifically sitting out this coffee shop it used to be in like the early nineties you didn't like people would always be like don't go east to 35 yeah it was super scary super sketch for whatever reason that stuff but that's why I 13 years ago"
1," when you bought that house I remember we were talking to a friend that point you were telling me about a couple years younger than you and I and I was wanting to learn about it and I was amazed at the time at your interest rate on that house at 10 so good it was so good it was such a good I couldn't believe you could get an interest rate that low"
1," required"
1," second to put a lot of people forget nowadays because that money became free for so long to near zero"
1," for the 2008 and then just stay there and everyone assumed that was the norm yes 7 back then I was I was I was in awe of it"
1," that. Cam crash"
1," like the if you want to get it is it all"
1," like most things in this country are goes back to racism by 35 didn't used to be called I believe Front Street and Front Street was the street that divided Austin into the white part of town in the minority part of town so east of Front Street which is now is to 35b came to mind was the designated minority part of town and only white people could live on the west side so that's why were they built 35 they demolished that street in the built 35 in its place that's why I remain to this day East and West Austin cuz it was a racist"
1," kind of a movement in like this I-35 expansion I'm talking about trying to improve Austin right to try to bulldoze 35 maybe bury it and then bridge bridge the parts of the city together"
1," absolute loading"
1," out of weird I want to see I want to see subdivision for the lot of weird names for areas are like designations for different neighborhoods that you have to get used to looking you really want to break it down like you could go by like neighborhood name and there's just like so many of us even I don't know all of those talking about like the change and the transformation of this part of town and even you know to the lesser extent like the division of the Town by I-35"
1," it makes me think about all the areas around Austin that I've seen significant change over the years like I think a lot about South Congress which is a really popular area that a lot of people go to and what a different place that used to be when I moved here even before I moved here like they used to be that South Congress was a super sketchy part of town"
1," theaters you know sex workers standing on the corner of people selling drugs and now there's like enormous store there's like"
1," yeah that place has blown up and I remember it like it was funny to watch that transformation was when I moved here in 98 when they were in the process of pushing all that out of Congress was under construction for years when I moved here it was like they're rebuilding it and when it finally reopened it was like a lot of like kitschy vintage shops and"
1," like like no big changes like a lot of like ditch and vintage retro stuff and to try to promote people to come down there they would do the same call first Thursday"
1," to South Congress and all the businesses would have free beer"
1," bit of food and there was also this other thing that we would do down there remember this we're back again in the late nineties they would be press screenings of movies they would advertise them in the chronicle like you would read through the the classifieds in the chronicle may be like hey free tickets to see American Beauty or whatever a man in the moon at 4 and pick up a free pass and you have to go there and they'd be like yeah it's like"
1," see this movie a week before it came out and you pick up the past 7 to be like go to the Metropolitan Saturday at 2 p.m. and you can watch this movie"
1," hours you didn't pay money to see a movie"
1," get into like the line and the line went down the street like there were two lines going in two different directions to down the street in each Direction and it was it was Madness that was that was a craziest movie of that type"
1," depressed mean that we went to ever go see"
1," there was so that the clap or less of it it would have a more positive experience for whoever was there from the press to review and we"
1," I think we can we see I think we even saw what they called Bruce Almighty"
1," Austin was like in the National Spotlight for being like a cool place to go so whenever we would go to like maybe there will be someone in"
1," that was the time like I remember like we were convinced when we went and saw South Park that Natalie Portman was going to be there cuz she was in town filming where the heart"
1," internet content delivered the Forum at once a week so I can do all that stuff eventually you know took off and became very nice websites that which is between popular"
1," 10 it was"
1," little bit why is it whenever there's a new piece of technology involved the first thing people try to do is create some type of form of South Park made Star Wars"
1," I thought speaking of their men think about something this is the first episode of the podcast been released like it's coming out now and there's a very unintended side"
1," podcast... I've been experiencing lately which is"
1," have started texting me with their version and their notes and their corrections to which I say get your own podcast"
1," they've been they've been other people who who texted him but you've been really stinks but this is all real battery from the comment that people leave on the podcast and that's the thing I try to impress upon them is that this is our point of view of what happened in those events you were not trying to be deceitful or you know but this is how our interpretation of what happened or what happened through our lands and through our eyes"
1," definitely very black and white I think I lived in a world of extremes it was either yes or no right or wrong"
1," play off the handle like if someone said you could killing Eve come out on AMC"
1,"but it is funny how how much you do too. I feel like I'm definitely much more mail it out that I was back then a lot less and less angry"
1," about some of the shit that we used to do when we were younger like nauseous nauseous we were like even the way we would behave when we would go out till like 6 Street like we would have been a lot of time on 6th Street like being drunk assholes like a totally obnoxious dick heads down. I don't know how I did not get the ship beat out of me every weekend I think I"
1," really got mad at each other people other friends of ours and other people that we knew that would also participate in this"
1," were fighting you sucker punch me like right in the stomach I doubled over the circle clear and as I was hitting the ground I was already laughing at but I was cracking"
1," so then I stood up and I was laughing and that group of people was still confused about what just happened punched in the stomach and was instantly"
1," or stupid or anything"
1," fighting"
1," I was bored yesterday pies I made blueberry hand pies I've"
1," but it was so bored yesterday and I never made a hand pie"
1," I know blueberries are coming into season now so I thought what I try to make blueberry hand pies"
1," I ate two of them yesterday"
1," don't like doing something nice for my wife and she likes blueberries and I was like oh you know I'll make you some blueberry hand pies and I know I work on them for like an hour and a half and then they were done and they're cool and I dab of one over the other they're not that great I think that there's a couple of things I think my work area wasn't big enough I think I over-worked to do and I didn't have the like the the sugar crystals to put on the top of the very end in the batter's of little dents and try and is not in the filling the building itself is really good cuz blueberries but the battery is a little too buttery in a little too over so I"
1," usually yeah I do listen to me"
1," I normally put on like 80s classic rock streaming the serenity of like the guy was just quiet okay with nothing and I was I was really into that yesterday"
1," would be better if it's not bad for a first attempt but actually I actually really enjoyed making quite a bit I should have a lot more kind of falling out of practice when I think it shows I do want to try this again I really like actually making blueberry muffins and I have some blueberries left over from this so I think either later tonight or maybe tomorrow I'll use those leftover blueberries and makes blueberry muffins Mondays are kind of busy for me my podcasts"
1," that's normally on Wednesdays or between Seasons right now so where I don't have to do that was about it I was about to spill over there"
1," soap to make 8 hand pies it was 8 oz of butter so basically I basically has an ounce of butter or 2 tbsp it was loud so much butter and butter said I think was overworked I think the cross should have been a bit more flaky I think the butter melts a little too much which is why I'd like to do kind of collapsed and didn't have Flakes and layers to it I'll do better next time. Well geez I was"
1," pick blueberries actually there's a place like between here in Houston where you do"
1," when we never talked about this but I'm sure we have that we talked about it in this podcast so that house you were talking about that you purchased"
1," that's how you met Bernie because he was the managers manager he was"
1," who was all like a management and your home application came across the desk but I guess I can come verification or something and you thought it was unusual that an hourly call Center employee was trying to buy a house"
1," I mean to put a testament to again but we kind of the underlying theme of this podcast has changed for a call center point me $8 an hour and you were by your house anyway when we first started RoosterTeeth I live with you in that house for for a while for like a year year-and-a-half when we were starting the company first started I quit my job and I didn't"
1," I have one and I moved it back in with my parents and it's always looking for free and you know it's kind of started Rooster Teeth and I was you know helping remotely with that stuff and then you know as the work increase I needed to come back to Austin to Bible getaway very briefly live with"
1," I spent all my time on the beach learn how to surf it was like a whole thing I could 20 years ago and then I moved back to Austin and since we were just fine the company I'm going to devote all my attention to it so Jeff very kindly let me live with him for like the first year I came back so that way I could just focus and have RoosterTeeth that's my job. Like it was just like handling customer service shit you know helping get things in order work on the website just like all the minutiae that needs to go on in order to lunch cuz they needed to watch company back then"
1," and it was a I spent a lot of fun memories in that house"
1," now. I had a vegetarian kalachi this morning"
1," on the weekends and"
1," when when"
1," and I would do the same for you it's weird that they are so much more difficult to be vegan back then that's the thing I was going to hit on the world has changed so much in the last 20 25 years like I don't know how you did it back to nowadays you go to any place and even if they're not like a specialty shop still have a small Sub menu for people who are vegan or vegetarian"
1," feel like vegan has a lot of connotation wait a lot of negative energy"
1," I looked over here at the blueberry and I just so grossed me out that I guess I couldn't think anymore"
1," so you didn't sell the house"
1," Travis County Appraisal District"
1," will go employment Jeff has a history or had a history with this HOA it's not like just out of nowhere this happened I didn't you threaten the president"
1," do want it back up just claim it was a boring Bland color there was nothing offensive about it"
1," staying sane or I do I do want to comment on responsible Jeff when I when I move back in with Jeff you know what we said I was living with him so I didn't want to have to pay rent have time to live as cheaply as possible so I bought a very cheap vehicle"
1," two black small car dealership off Lamar and I bought a 1964 Chevy pickup and I thought this is a cheap car and it's like simple songs by like a book on how to fix it and if it breaks I can work on it I can fix it and I think I'll be buying that old car like kindled a desire and Jeff also have an old vehicle yes so just wanted a Bronco and after looking for 12 hours she couldn't find one so he bought an old truck like me"
1," a mechanic when you more than me to like good stuff I couldn't do and like just learning how to fix it for the most part more reliable eventually did reach a point though where the engine needed to be"
1," I remember what happened to cause that but hit the engine in his truck died so he took it to the shop and pay for brand new engine they put brand new tuna. Fix it and put it in his truck took the truck home park in the driveway and then didn't drive it for two years it's sat"
1," fluid in that vehicle just like because of gravity float to the bottom the tires all rotted and the engine never worked again like he had a new engine put in that truck drove it home and that was the extent of the work that you engine did because after that all the oil had gone"
1," I loved that truck that I have that 1964 Chevy I learned so much I change the the fuel pump out into the street in front of your house and over that and but like I said they had no air conditioning everywhere I think that year if I remember right 1964 was the first year you could buy air conditioning as an option on that truck and it wasn't like it was built into the vehicle it was like it was like a portable air conditioner under the dash and just kind of sat there brutal so everywhere I went I had to drive with the the windows down call most dudes are always trying to get in the back and remember that stops at a red light and there be some dude I'll try to get in the back you don't have to be screaming at them like at the fuck out of my truck"
1," back"
1," at that time tell me about driving a 1960 Chevy pickup in Austin any dude at the corner could get in your bed and you have to yell at them and scream at them to get the fuck out of"
1," it would be funny if it happened once or twice but it was any time I stopped at that truck and there was a dude standing at"
1," I felt like that honestly"
1," was the influence of the smaller towns to the South East Highway 71 a lot driving on Highway 71 south east of here like out towards Columbus have you passed me like LaGrange Smithville all the small towns that was a lot more coming, not there so you would see that move over here in to Austin vape and driving straight to the gallon it was brutal no air conditioner but it was loud and Fast meeting that time wear seat belts were an option and if you had the vehicle delivered and it still didn't have seatbelts you did not have to rush back and we put them in mine was delivered from the factory with lap belts do I have to use a lap belt"
1," but it didn't matter if you got into a wreck and I think you were dead oh yeah for looking at that"
1," if I remember right was about 15 Gallons at that time gas was probably like a bucket and maybe a buck 20 there was not expensive"
1," remember when I moved in my life would have been like a little kid and I remember seeing if like forty-five cents"
1," but I moved often in 98 I lived off of Riverside and there was a guy that lives a gas station has a Diamond Shamrock off of Oltorf I would go to all the time he was across from where 14 was area and the gas there was always 98 cents a gallon and I remember it was either 99 or 2000 when it finally went to like 101"
1," I just hit $4 a gallon here in Austin"
1," years has Chinese restaurants off of Oltorf and Montopolis Wickersham with a Chinese restaurant and I remember when I moved here in 1998 I was like driving around the neighborhood cuz I was trying to that get a feel for everything that was in the area and I drove by one Foo and they had a big banner out front and the banner so we got our liquor license back"
1," that place if that's my kind of"
1," it was like a 24-hour Chinese food place we're hanging out at my apartment at the metropolis and remember this and Texas has weird laws were like you can't buy liquor after 9 or you can't buy liquor on Sunday the weird loopholes and I think we were hanging out like at 3 in the morning playing video games and we wanted beer but we couldn't buy beer anywhere so we told my roommate but I can't go to lunch with six pack and I remembered I remember that we got our liquor license back side and I thought the Jews play ball and my roommate didn't really have any like he wouldn't get embarrassed by"
1," YouTube back with a six pack 3 in the morning like at 3 in the morning bought a six-pack of beer and brought it back to our apartment"
1," damp you're through humid in that restaurant"
1," over there they had one food to for a long time ago Springs Road over there like we're kind of surfboard shop Style Diner building and want food and they also had a food truck for a while off of Duval and if you know that I'm in the clothes the food truck and moved over there off of Airport and Guadalupe it's a Chinese restaurant now China family that was"
1," 1 2 3 4 a"
1," and then one who wanted to close I want to 3 with your windows open for a long time then they raise for rent or whatever became a Korean restaurant and I believe the woman who ran wanfu at the time I ended up going to like off of Mopac and Parmer look out behind the fries and she moved over there I don't know if it's still there. So far I never go out"
1," months"
1," where I want food to building used to be now it's funny that now it's like they're just they're just having food trucks"
1," a building in a business"
1," mystery about the new Austin Moon but I"
1," a really good one"
1," came up with a scream all of these are very in MA it's not like that"
1," word in animal that starts with the letter"
1," there might be another one we do before we wrap this project up"
1," we still haven't talked about"
1," what restaurant did this all"
1," picture of us recording audio that you posted that was not taken with the crotch camera that was a different camera it was around that time but it was"
1," set"
2," was deleted I meant the car driver was off was formatted and then it was shredded so that's good"
2," doing it every time I've been trying to start the podcast to like cut you off to make you forget"
2," more consistent than episode 3 but I think it's more low-key if"
2," Thunderbird on Manor there's a big truck I just had a Thunderbird on Manor I've been to this place before pandemic for I would have been like two maybe three years since I've been out"
2," weird to me that you know just down the road from here is bird bird biscuit and there used to be another Manor over on 2222 and that one became a bird bird biscuit on trays and it closed and became a bird bird biscuit which are all correct but vary depending on where you are on the road"
2," it's also the same as like to 90 Ben White and 71 which is west of 35 East of 35 it's only 71 internal height 335 becomes 290 it's like the intricacies of living in Austin you're like you would say Mueller and not Miller because it's definitely not Miller cuz that's not right at all like that's a way to tell if someone doesn't actually live in Austin it's when they say the wrong name for something"
2," funny to me is that I guess that might have been true at one point but then like Lonestar me like a hipster Revival Renaissance and then it came back and then it was definitely truth which is weird because I felt like there was a similar thing we kind of do we talked about this and we I think we kind of game of Jason to a conversation like this in an earlier up some but I think we have a really dug into it but Craft Beer & like Mike Rowe brewers brewers in Austin in Texas I guess seem like it wasn't a thing forever then it became a huge thing because like for a while like the independent beer you wanted to drink or Shiner and that was it it was like you either drink like Budweiser horse trainer and then that was that was an option"
2," cost-cutting how much does it take to print out of a"
2," Thunder before like 2008-2009 so it's always been signed over to me so"
2," are we going to talk about like businesses cuz I'm looking at Hoover's over your"
2," restaurant"
2," think anyone who ever made for the Tar Heels pet ever seen salt or pepper in there like they have no idea what spice was any kind of flavor you wanted black and white gravy on a chicken fried steak that tasted like nothing I mean 30th was a place for you"
2," I mean yeah I guess it's not around anymore or whatever for a long time but I just never really"
2," I'm working a lot about you the first time with you yeah probably thought it was forever ago back in 99 or 2000 maybe 2001 we ate there with Zak"
2," the first time I ever ate there"
2," these are really good Thunderbird Coffee is so"
2," ordering hot americanos here very soon as we take the podcast outside I'm glad that we're recording outside even though it's raining today"
2," out by all the rain have enough having to tape inside"
2," Hoovers and Zack is I feel like that's a good way to talk about some of the earlier website that we made that may disconnect"
2," I work at a call center is like we kind of touched on this a couple episodes to go about how you have that z90 how to make web servers and kind of knew a little bit about like HTML and stuff and we wanted to make website I think I had a domain back then you can only register domains with one company whose $70 a year to register domain with internet and I had a domain show me the monkey, remember that"
2," evolving around that just a simple Flash animation of a monkey sitting in a tree eating a banana I believe that your girlfriend at the time. By the time I thought was funny that the call center for every now and then Bernie and Jeff would quote unquote Hackett since we all had access to the server and they would like to put a pirate hat on the monkey or an eye patch or something"
2," PG and I have this domain and then that movie with Brendan Fraser right Monkeybone Monkeybone came out at in the trailer he like look straight in the camera and shouts show me the monkey nose like my website"
2," was it was like oh my God they said our website like that that we all night with nothing Monkeybone and show me the money into"
2," but I think that was like the start of like hey you know maybe we can collaborate and do stuff together on the internet and our first idea for a web site we collaborated on was called ugly internet"
2," to I never really talked about like dropping out of college and moving from Houston to Austin want to touch on that very briefly before we get into the internet thing I started college in the fall of 96 at rice in Houston. I received grants and every semester when it won't go to like the registrar's office to pay their tuition I would go get in line to get a check from the"
2," at the time like I have started doing web stuff in 94 when like the first version of Netscape Navigator what should I use MC as a mosaic and then which we came misket Navigator and 96-97 I was sitting there you know we had internet in the college and I was sitting there with faster internet for the first time in my life and I was like no I could stay here I was not a great student so"
2," free for the first time in my life and I was just playing video games and fucking off all the time but I thought I could sit here in like really apply myself and finish and get a degree but by the time I finish in the year 2002 in turn it like the early days of Internet are going to be gone I need to quit college and I need to jump on this now I didn't have money or I could move to California where everyone was you know all the Silicon Valley stuff was happening was like a"
2," and I'm sure there's other people I can find who also want to do stuff on the internet and we can make this happen so I moved up so I work at a call center and it wasn't a glamorous job at least it was like kind of attack if you can meet people with who were Tech minded so it was great for that anyway so will you be at you show me my key we get to the point where we decide we're going to work make a website together and you know we start walking to make ugly internet.com and it's a website and again we might remember something."
2," we were assholes it's a website where we decided everyone had at the time like Awards on their websites like the beautiful whatever website award and the web Rings were thing"
2," some type I mean I guess they had website where you could maybe"
2," where George Lucas was suing anybody can put Star Wars images on their way to do you know it was a very very different place so we decided we were going to make a website where we were going to rape other people's websites and tell him how bad they were and send them ugly Awards and then we took it a step further I was a real"
2," little bit drowsy more of a big nerd back then I would petition the American registry of Internet numbers to revoke their IP addresses have you like we're running out of IP addresses this website is wasting one that I know the website to be using and I send letters trying to get website to remove from the internet for being too ugly and we will post them on our website on the internet"
2," joke right they weren't they were not at all"
2," them in last year's so ugly internet shockingly was the source of our first death threat to hear I don't know if we ever figured out who exactly was"
2," person said they were going to kill us sent us photos of where we lived send me pictures of my truck Google Maps and"
2," number was at the building where the Omni is downtown at like what is that 7th and Brazos so we went over there to try to find the person they're closed I'm going to find a person in a building we just like walked around the entire building to get elevators up to every floor like trying to go into every door we"
2," the omni's in there"
2," so we just like we found out where there's like private the doors open and someone just turned it looks at you like what the fuck are you doing here"
2," but we did talk to the internet for a year-and-a-half two years I was it that long"
2," you remember okay so I'm going to make a call back here Robert used to always carry a baseball bat in his trunk and do you remember what he would do with will like his his process with a baseball bat"
2," house with a suitcase full of beer and whiskey kept a baseball bat in his trunk but he said that if you ever got pulled over and a compound with a bat in the"
2," truck they would know you're up to no good so he kept like a bag with a baseball glove some baseballs and like he's not wrong"
2," bat"
2," Christ"
2," mouth me personally I've never been a smoker but I have known people who have been smokers in the past and it seems like a common theme among stall of them is when they do try to quit they all talk about how tough it can be and the trials of having to go through in order to try to meet a wean themselves off of cigarettes nowadays luckily though there's a product called fume fume is a natural inhaler design for a better safer natural way to quit cigarettes no smoke no Vape no nicotine replacement for the hand-to-mouth habit of smoking if you had Crestwood inhalers and uses course if you plant oils suited to curb Cravings bear flavors like peppermint and Conquer with Mickey notes to simulate menthol cigarettes and other flavors like cozy chai and lemon berry Bliss for a sweeter experience and all of their flavors are one hundred percent natural no harmful chemicals no artificial flavors absolutely no nicotine stuff but few can really help they got thousands of five star reviews from smokers who have tried everything else and this"
2," for them so whether your smoker or egg smoker who still strong the craving or maybe you know someone who tried to quit maybe you can offer this you can you can send a suggestion to them is a perfect tool for you for the head over to breathe fume.com enema and use promo code and want to save 10% off your entire order the 10% off your entire order when you head to b r e a t h e r f u m.com anman Hughes code anma"
2,"so yeah we did. That was pretty much the end of ugly inner and outer think we ever like we never said let's end this or let's stop doing that he was just like this new"
2," for suggestions for websites"
2," okay"
2," was gone like restaurant right out of the knuckle"
2," was removed when they reattached the"
2," goes even if you weren't immediately in the shock immediately feel"
2," proof-of-concept for what I wanted to do and mind you this was I want to see a 99-2000 maybe 2001 somewhere in that area we were"
2," right after that we like all right you know ugly internet we're going to Shell out that you come up with a new concept and we loved drinking and playing video games or like or it will just make our new website will be drunk anymore so it'll be just what we want to get video game companies to send us free video games so that we can review them for our video game review site drunk Gamers will be just getting hammered and then talk about video games do the garage sale stories for that we talked about in the previous"
2," Japanese God I did not want you buy sock it cost plus"
2," so drunk I remember laying on that couch is hating everything about the world but it is allowed us to learn about building online for sale and you know we were using our names I guess I was always cuss but it allowed us to let each of us picked a like a console and we're like this is my fault. It was like I'm going to be like the pro PS2 guy the pro Xbox guy the probe dreamcastguy whatever right and just like really try to write to a style and develop a Persona in that fear cuz you know if you'll take me to games are very territorial about consoles and stuff and we were shooting"
2," you want to play something out I think that we did that was very revolutionary when it came to drunk Gamers we live streamed playing video games on the internet in the year 2011 IP based camera beep screen to the web and we're likely to do a stunt we're going to stream video games for 24 hours or going to stream it to drunk Gamers and we try to get my people to write about it and we did we set up and I was at my apartment over there by Barton Creek mall yeah we set up and we stayed up for 24 hours playing video games the streaming it to"
2," upload to our website but it was you know if any of any decent you start watching it was just like slow down and throttled where was like an image a second or name is every 2 seconds or so kind of a slideshow and we definitely didn't have the bandwidth where but it was like an early attempt at trying to life"
2," a video game to the internet"
2," like a cloud"
2," We learned that definitely very early on you have I think I see if I remember right I want to say that Penny Arcade even made a like a blog post about the fact that we were going to be doing the 24-hour streaming think when we did it yeah you know a back way into the year 2004 we can try to get we we all red Penny Arcade and we were just trying to get like other people in the video game spear to write about us and have helped promote us so we could get our website be"
2," I still have my ugly internet sure"
2," I still have that old so I need to find it I know where it is I need to look at it see what it says and"
2," to continue as there was no social media I mean Google was still new at the time like I remember my using Google for the first time in 9899 like like there was crazy to think now that these in trench Technologies in the way we use the web just didn't really exist or like in DeBary infant stages of the time I never lose my train of thought in any other podcast to make sense as the old man taught"
2," wanted to go that I lost my can't get back to know now and we learned it was a hard lesson to learn but we learned it after a while"
2," that no video game company wants to be associated with people who use Goose label themselves drugs or alcohol alcohol like that we leveraged that website into being able to attend E3 because it was now we we had credentials we had a website we did reviews and III was a lot more strict about who could go in you have to definitely prove you had credentials and you were legitimate so we all attended E3 in 2001 for the first time"
2," the real quick"
2," so I had to pay my own way to go to to E3 in"
2," that was a crazy year because the Xbox original Xbox was not out yet it was like Microsoft Grand unveiling the Xbox One and Xbox came out November 3rd like 6 months before the Xbox came out and launch titles I was drunk on margaritas and I slipped on the ice on the convention floor and I looked down everything I slipped on with a press pass that someone had fallen off of someone's lanyard eventually replace my pass with the price tag on it remember this I got into the Press only area to Microsoft booth and like to try to like get shit to write about for drunk Gamers and to try to get content but with quotes with weird to me is this was the first time that the public got their hands on the video game Halo and bungee was there showing it off and they had a webcam that would take images every now and then and upload it to their website"
2," if you go to the archive you'll find an image of us standing there playing Halo for the first"
2," was staring at it like in amazement and it's weird how influential that game we came to us later on for you no future projects that we haven't even touched on yet"
2," he was in that police"
2," and if you look at that I'm wearing a red Hawaiian shirt and it was wearing that because it was another game coming out that I was excited about state of emergency and one of the main characters wear that red bull actually works and you know it was going to a trade show which was very difficult impossible probably to get into you know as a general public trying to make contact and learning how to interact with people in this industry were trying to break into an and learn more about a guy we saw the Metal Gear Solid 2 trailer going to go play at the top of the hour and the Konami booth on at giant screen is like it was it was a crazy E3 to go to us the first one"
2," I think we had a very strong fake it till you make it attitude but not in like the phony taking an investment money kind of way not like faking projection and Danielle Financial bulshit it was very much like we're just going to project an aura of success and we're going to act like we belong"
2," you had a website like that was nuts"
2," that in itself was legitimacy but yet so I have no idea I couldn't tell you now I can tell you how to do it 20 25 years ago these days man good luck everyone trying to do that I wasn't we were definitely fortunate to be early and you know jumping on the bed earlier if I stay in college have been doing this we had a head start on on trying to do all of this stuff and in front of it I"
2," like we weren't making a lot of money we were trying to find hobbies that we could parlay into free stuff whether it's free movies by reading the chronicle free music while doing a punk scene free video games by doing drunk Gamers I was always like let's if we're to be doing this stuff for fun let's try to focus it in a productive way we get something out of it"
2," so yeah"
2," those guys we used to go to the Funko land over there in Sunset Valley which is a GameStop Now by got used to be CompUSA whatever is at Michael's now and the guys who work there when you all of the staff and then you would like we were going to be costly coming in and then days and getting a different game I got carded at that game stop when I bought Conker's Bad Fur Day"
2," and have been like 22 when I came out here to be 17 to buy and I got carded to buy that video game which is dumb as hell to me"
2," and use too much like coconut curry light coconut milk in there cuz I'm not a fan of that Ray and Jay Ray both love that place or something"
2," sometimes if I'm bored that are you talking about the old the old stomping"
2," so I remember that when I first moved to Austin LOL remember I always remember this well I'm going to remember this date forever now because it has taken on your meeting but it was January 6th 1998 and I moved into an apartment complex off of Riverside at Riverside and Royal Crest and like I moved in a movie with a friend of mine Joe he lived in a studio and he very kindly let me sleep on his floor"
2," first night I was there like I moved up I had like a shity little truck in like a box of stuff and I was like okay I live in Austin out I don't know I've been Austin many times but never like on my own as an adult right well yeah for the most part I live in Austin so like I need to if I'm going to be living here I need to know the city so I went across the street and Riverside you know that HEB right there at like Riverside in Pleasant Valley and bag this big has been rebuilt that's not the same"
2," so I went there and in the parking lot of the old H-E-B on it remember this seems to be an Exxon gas station and I went to Exxon gas station and I bought a city map of the city of Austin and I took it back to the apartment and I like sitting I was sleeping on the floor I like unfurled the city map on the floor and I like put like with a pen I like the circle for I live and I circled that HEB has all right I need to learn the city like I'm going to like Circle places I've been to so I remember where everything is and I learn the layout of the city and like that was day one except one when I am at learn my way around this town"
2," and I think day too if I remember right January 7th maybe January 8th I went to that old movie theater that was right there. Who's getting worse like now it's a Chinese buffet Joy East Presidio I want to say is what the movie theater was called I went over there cuz Jackie Brown was playing it was like one of the first things I did not date today 3 I went and I watch Jackie Brown in the theater at the theater"
2," it's funny now because we work with another guy named Brian gaar who at that time worked at that theater and he always talks about specifically you look showings of Jackie Brown when I was there watching a screening of Jackie Brown is that the"
2," we were watching Stigmata"
2," I think Jason might have been there in April and maybe a beer Margaret was there two anyway we all went down and like halfway through the movie you know how movie theaters you normally enter from the back by the doors are at the back alley. To login everything under the screen please let you go out to the parking lot we're watching Stigmata and one of those doors under the screen at the front of the theater opened"
2," delivery driver with a pizza and you looked around this dark theater is like Mike Mike and when some dude says I go over here"
2," and there's people take this money and then walked right back out that door"
2," never forget that and I order Domino's Pizza"
2," go there with you when you go out drinking but if I was going to go out drinking it was difficult because she know yeah yeah that was that was that was definitely like home base for for anyting if it's Nostalgia or just being old now but it felt like back then it was definitely easier to park here parked like right from the casino and walk right in but it felt like there was a"
2," as Rowdy or crazy in the downtown area has many people in general so it wasn't like this overwhelming Crush constantly on the weekend I"
2," do we have time to talk about Rainey Street"
2," 24s people know what today is like a bunch of bars and like"
2," a couple hotels down there at the end"
2," yeah condos it's like eateries it's very like hip part of town very much a destination like what if you know you're busy and whatever"
2," it didn't used to be but back before all of this was built and used to just be run those seem Craftsman homes built before they were fixed up run down with a hundred years of wear and tear on them just like falling apart like holes in the roof you know a plywood hole plugging up a hole in the wall like you're really dilapidated falling"
2," it's not to say it like it was a scary part of town or they just like there was no reason to go there if you live there sure but you know it's really close to downtown but why would you"
2," we had a friend who lived there in one of the few rent he didn't you know he didn't own the house he lived he rented that house with some other friends mutual friends and they all lived in this house who was at the northwest corner of"
2," so we spent time down there quite a bit hanging out with with his friend of ours and his house and every now and then you know if you have like a house party invite a bunch of people over and I remember one time we were you both we both were at the party"
2," his party and there's a keg of beer which is shocking cuz kids are expensive and you know none of us really has any"
2," okay let's go get a beer we just arrived there so Jeff and I have a beer at Lonestar medieval I don't know what is this talking about I never met those two people over there brought the pig is deaf whatever Bawa"
2," okay we left"
2," who knows who knows there's absolutely wild I have drank beer that's been found in the woods before in my life"
2," position became what it is now is nothing like what it was before"
2," I saw about Rainey Street I saw someone actually posted this podcast"
2," did the Austin subreddits on a few days ago really yeah and it was interesting because there was one person who let the, do something like people complain about how often used to be better I'll pass and you know that is to take away whenever I would never try to talk about how things used to be"
2," our life it was a different city than things things didn't get worse or things have definitely changed but that's not the theme of this podcast has not the things got worse that things have changed"
2," get something retrospective looking back maybe doesn't age thing they were getting to the point where looking everything looking at everything and trying to look at it whenever possible I remember this is unrelated but I remember back in 2001 when I was working at that other job downtown for the first time"
2," making good money like I was hired you and I to work for this company I was 23 years old and they're paying me $62,000 a year in the year 2001 I was like I was like I'm loaded"
2," house right by the house he was like really good time like I was looking to buy a house in Tarrytown contact a realtor and there was a nice house with a corner lot I want to say it was a two bedroom one and a half bath. Very big house on nine hundred thousand square feet something like that and we're looking through a realtor showed me the house and it's $300,000 and I remember laughing like no one's ever going to pay $300,000 for this house that is absolutely ridiculous I'm not buying this house that house is probably worth like two million dollars today"
2," everywhere our website Reddit on different podcast ask the comments someone somewhere on in the internet has the right idea. I could see the thought process was starting on that. That's the closest anyone is coming"
2," a lot of good guesses by the way please keep sending them either like I read all the reviews or or website Reddit whoever"
2,"if a rooster teeth production"
2," when you get old that you need very little sleep so it doesn't matter it's just uncomfortable."
2," Epoch but is it supposed to be like at B I call it Epoch because that's how you pronounce the word the word you pronounce it is epic well there's but there's an agent there"
2," nature."
2," I lost the ability to say to you. After I played that the definition"
2," Loop first minor fear when I got here a little early cuz I was coming from the office I had to do some audio and I had my first beer when I thought this might be the first one to the first but that's a lot of locations and what if we met in different locations"
2," this is definitely like the fact that I think of one of the give you back but I actually"
2," Farwest more often these days"
2," they're so I found myself up their belly if you eat at pastrami I was waiting to see"
2," and talk up there"
2," Guadalupe"
2," 40 43rd and Guadalupe I want to say and it has been there for at least"
2," follow that's what I think of but you're right it was here for a while they were both open to like you could either other and then this one closed down and I'm going to be kind of happy I like this one guy was small and the new one is got some with maroon and there was a period of time when I rented a house in Hyde Park's I was getting some construction online and so I would walk over to Workhorse I had a little solo routine I would do every Sunday I would walk over to Workhorse I would drink three beers and watch football on the TV and then walk home and it was like my like my son gave me time one was pretty good today a good burger"
2," Austin places are still there pockets are gone right I think you're dead on there and this is where people I've read some cynicism people talking about our podcast ever heard of yet who I think that I assume that we are the writing the changing of one of your pockets has been such a wild ride to watch everything happening to get to be a present for so much changed but I think you have keyed into something if you come to Austin in 2022 and you here"
2," talk about the way Austin was in the 90s and early 2000 went by the way when I came to Austin in the 90s and you came in and I need people talk about how the way also was in the seventies but this is what they're talking about go to like Uncommon Objects or is that might go to room service go been proved right across is a cool place to get a mixed drink Workhorse monkeywrench books yeah that's that's been there for a long time that is what like a lot of awesome aesthetic and feel and kind of vibe a lot of awesome had I would argue that it is also exists in Crestview I just didn't know Crestview existed until like"
2," that's a"
2," Fence Austin"
2," did I saw I just remind you that makes you feel old but be slightly worse than that I was on Twitter yesterday from posted that"
2," I was talking about 80s movies now is the same as our parents talking about Casablanca in 2020 talking about a DAT this weekend"
2," yeah I'm pretty sure there was a dude doing some sort of needle drugs over there on the other side of that to you went over there yeah that's"
2," I also like at the early on in the pandemic you could buy like a fight like a milk jug full of coffee from them too I would get like he can't drink the water in Austin thing I've never experienced can't I mean can't drink the water cuz something happened to it never experienced until I moved here is that like you guys have lived here for long and other studies that pretty consistent like and they just don't do anything about it to make it a better"
2," this year's or whatever I feel like every 3 years or so you got to boil your water"
2," do you want to hear some facts a little bit of trivia about Epoch that I remember to be true but probably isn't absolutely intro Dennis and put together a special song for Epoch"
2," coffee fat"
2," I remember that years and years and years ago did that Epoch was opened by a group of people and that one there was some sort of a falling-out and one of those people left and started be new and that's not being a nor'easter that's why it's 24 hours a day as well basically recreated Epoch over on the east side as be no I just remember that being something someone told me that I've accepted as fact"
2," I don't know if he could get past the empty pack of watermelon grape Swisher's so I mean that's pretty tough and the McDonald's bag we should be okay"
2," about the cemetery though"
2," Austin shot now I thought you spell just walk in there I didn't know that"
2," this is be a chain link fence and it would open and then you just like I'd walk early to drink coffee back in the day maybe that's why it's secure now maybe you were never supposed to but I think it was and I think that there are there not a lot of headstones there but I believe there are many many many people buried I think there's a lot"
2," I didn't know that it was like when I moved here and I'll drive by it all the time as a cemetery just never kind of like realized I just bought a land and then started looked closer while driving and went"
2,"why they had a frustrating Texas State Hospital experience. Antonio Texas State Hospital Austin say whatever they don't know what the hospitals called anymore in the basement for a different stuff we may be a year ago they were low on shoes we need to choose for people that you know where are there and said they were accepting donations and I had just come off of and this addiction to Vans and so I had like forty pairs of shoes I was not going to wear socks you so I donated like 20 pairs of shoes and I just threw them all in H-E-B bags and I took him then that's it just like bring him up to the security gate or whatever and we'll accept him and I and I took him to the the lady that was working security there and she's like one of these"
2," they will you guys requesting shoes to be donated and so I'm done any shoes for the the people that are here is because I don't know what you're talking about agents for like 4 days today is the final day I can donate and she's like I don't know just leave them on the street and I was like on the street and she just had me leave them on the street and ATV bags next to and so I assume that that's where they still are I don't know"
2," as frustrating good luck to the city now I mean they would have if he actually gave him the hospital they belong. You said that you found in the basement what what is this so the state hospital yeah it's like it's one of the buildings are super super old and so when we were filming our ghost-hunting show we would do like the first portion of it was like a campfire scene we would tell the ghost stories around the campfire and then we would re-enact them can like talk history and so we filmed some scary stuff in the basement there and I know I know way back in the day we found some stuff we ever Joel some stuff there and"
2," a dark basement with a hundred old"
2," hospital beds dilapidated in a pile and 11 doll with one arm and a missing"
2," out the driver is Camp Mabry the west of Mopac yeah I'm sure they just"
2," that"
2," yeah I get that gas is a Randall's over there"
2," it detailed stuff it was fine it was built that way 20 years ago or whatever just would like the population of cuz you guys lived like out here was like oh man this is like so"
2," lived in everything but at the time like it was like those probably didn't feel like bottlenecks and everything right like that that's just the way that stuff was built and who cares there was no such thing as traffic right now in the opening scene of all the Spectre"
2," Jeff I hate"
2,"I hate it I hate it so much"
2," you ever been good at something but not as good as you want to be in a makes you hate that thing that was me and bowling and when I decided that I was it was no longer be a going to be a part of my life I left it in the rearview mirror very far through view mirror I only even attempted a bowl because I was so desperate for friends and then I remember the night I remember I did terribly it to me it's not worth it friends are worth it"
2," apologize do you bowl now"
2," good at it you have a glow up in a ball and you don't believe you gave it to the state hospital maybe how did but you're good like you're going to throw up my parents were bowling leagues I join the bowling league when I was like 14 and then I bowled every Saturday and I think Wednesday until I graduate high school I went to like state tournaments and shit and I don't want to be rude but the realization came from I just made me frustrated because it's like in your head you know what to do and you tell your body what to do and then your buddy usually does it was known as it doesn't and it's like why I didn't tell you to do that like why that makes no sense that's not the negotiation that I had with you arm but in addition to that I like 17 or 18 when I was coming out of it and I just like"
2," I just I I saw the people that I like I still want to be part of that family anymore cuz that makes sense I just like I just didn't want to be a part of the bowling family anymore and weekends and of them does it get really good at it I'd have to commit more time and I just have been more time around people I didn't want to spend time with than doing something that genuinely made me mad at myself like I just"
2," Close"
2," John said it is also said that door pool closed and and I always felt like I discovered are both too late I think it's like middle of neighborhoods and no I didn't find out until like 3 or 4 years ago it was the first time I went to eat lunch there was like right before they close and I think I got to go check it out before it's gone"
2," as to take like 130 they're like not around it's like you have to go towards like Dell Diamond the"
2," think that an old building would just have some batting machines in it and like some nuts and it's like let me pay you quarters to hit baseball"
2," batting cage for something I just want to do passing Lee What If instead of quarters we charged Bitcoin and will be billionaire"
2," 1st"
2," 6 but that was just for music right like it was just a music festival to me back then I assume that the other ship was there too I just wasn't and so I just remember cuz it was 96 a band I wanted to see and I did was a banker Less Than Jake and it was $36 for wristband a number between 1 and play Life Is Wild and I know go to a bunch of the shows but yeah they didn a wristband I"
2," the equivalent of what I had that has over a"
2," building was kind of like a big Monument to our hubris for a brief period of time and we just had to look at it for years and years and years and I remember I do remember that they would I don't know if it was for a long time but they and they started doing Ariel dancing the structure to have people like dancing ropes and cables and shit but they still do it"
2," crazy really long"
2," there"
2," skyscraper Forum I have for very long time and I ruined the plans for that came out and it was one of the ugliest looking sets of blueprints I've ever seen and nobody was happy about the ending that building that built and it's actually quite striking I think"
2," sure it's wrapped around that parking light you're there was a lot of"
2," off of"
2," about we're talking about earlier and that like his early 90s house by now remind me that show I went to was at the back room is first time I've ever done to the back room"
2," the most heavy metal bar called the back room are a cute I like it so if you wanted to see like I don't know like one night it would be like Deathcore grindcore band and the next night it would be like a metal band the next night it would be like a skinhead boy band and it was just like if you like and then tomorrow night it's like a band that date but you know Killswitch Engage or what like one of those men and it was crazy about that bar I was amazed it lasted as long as it did because there was a pool hall side on the left at the bar was split you walk in the front that you got a ride to go to this very dark run down Club ritzy bands are going to be very narrow to"
2," memory and then you would go and it's a pool hall like Fishel bar and on Friday nights they would have $0.10 well drinks don't like 11 p.m. or 11 p.m."
2," 9798 so you would go there and there would be a bunch of like metal necks as we used to call him like redneck metal dudes see you in a band playing and fucking hammer and then on the other side you would just have the people that show up to get drunk for ten cents a drink as well be a lot like a lot of gangs and then a lot of just like really sketchy unsavory dude and there was always a fight"
2," he was so regular I got caught in a riot there I was seeing this band called the cro-mags play and I was there was another band was opening for him who were like friends of friends and they were staying at my house and so I was just like in the parking lot after the show and some dude walked by with a rebel flag belt buckle on"
2," and it started a fight with some of the dudes that are hanging out there and then it turned on the way full blown like 40 people fighting in the street nobody knew who was fighting who or why and I was just like standing like to get the fuck out of here I saw a cop run up and Maze two girls in the face and then shove them off like a loading dock and they just fucking 8shit it was bad and I was like I grabbed the friends and we got we have a friend I"
2," he's just like literally walking in an 18 year old kid to go to the punk show and like opens the door to get the bottles get the front teeth knocked out what is molar Kracker Yeah Yeah second place it was that kind of place you knew it couldn't last forever it was just a matter of when that Arrow was going to end the"
2," apartment and your crooked a"
2," side east side east facing side of that building and brick building called the other place to get the beer place with the fallen over Dude"
2," Enderman Ginger it stays in and I feel like Fox and the Hound and Ginger Man were beers that are bars we went to not all the time with a friend of like"
2," and start our own devices we we we are like three places we wanted to go but we always end up going places with other people and they bulldozed in that or something similar and then they never they had to tear the bar down to put a high-rise and then just nothing happens I think eventually years I think there's something there now"
2," what is the what what is the one restaurant that used to ear the used to eat at that you miss that's gone now like a relic of the past is any"
2," before way I never got"
2," year"
2," Health Springs french fries and onion rings right everybody started friends out but they had the best onion rings on their good fucking planet and its some point they change the rest of them and those those two different onion rings and it's spoiled it for me"
2," and it was open late"
2," yeah I was talking about a little bit I don't want the last episode of that area and Austin motel and kind of how it all Revitalize and I forgot to mention that"
2," what time in 1994 we were in the Army we were going to Corpus for the weekend and we stopped in Austin for the night on the way down after work and we go to like hang out in the open so we spent the night at the Austin Motel just like 35 bucks and there was like prostitutes prostitutes opening doors when he pulled in and it was still a fight it was a very different place"
2," where the Mexican museum is now like at 4th and Congress or 30"
2," when you got there all those supposedly there's a there's a bar on Webberville Cavalier and supposedly they have the recipe for the fries item try them but it's like the same family that owns Shaggy's owns Cavalier or like family lineage and I have the recipe."
2," what sparked of the reason for this podcast write send off the old places but discover the new ones together maybe the exact same boat where it's just like it's overwhelming you know once you get a few more coffee shops I think we have to expand to try some of like these are the restaurants to go get these jerk fries and we got to go to Lake Casino that seems like a good spot we have to just like go to"
2," since I went with one or both of you so I would love to go back"
2," and they knew too"
2," I stumbled into boyfriend drama is when I was there I remember like her boyfriend was a soccer player at the school at wherever they went to school sale ads or something and I was like we like so I stepped in as a joke and we stepped in hockey or soccer boyfriend drama and we got the fuck out of there"
2," man"
2," that side of sixty was always lost on us the people that go to like Maggie Mae's and Pete's peanuts"
2," because I"
2," as friends and I had friends and Eric what's in my head I don't remember being too crazy about it"
2," we're getting on towards the end but I mean we've been doing this for about 50 minutes the other episodes have been like we were focused or like yours a story from this specific spot I feel like this specific spot let us in so many different directions because it just got really tangential right like it was the cemetery in that sort of talk I like we got to like jerk fries and stuff like we were all over"
2," they was it on top, like how I feel like it was kind of like their version of how like almost lampooning how Hyde Park Grill has the Giant on top of it during Thanksgiving"
2," hang in there on the mini mini yes I wanted to get to a couple of guesses for the name another time around the M being in the middle"
2," another meaningless autobiography I think that's pretty I think that's pretty prevalent antidote to my anxiety Austin not my Austin is a really prevalent guess so if you think that that's the name of the podcast you don't have to send that in an embarrassment to Austin the M being the second letter in"
2," somebody had tweeted and Gus actually replied and said hey is and was titled multilingual I had made a mess of Austin in mucho Adventures so I'm just curious"
2," like I said good question English only"
2," dream in Spanish sometimes it sometimes"
2," like I had I"
2," other guests for the the name of the podcast that you're currently on how about and my ex that's about on the smaller side. I mean this was anything more always"
2," it's just a cup of coffee at 10. That gets cold fast it's a seven or an eight I mean I think it's a fine cup of coffee I looked and the idea of being this early and just a place that we go to there's no like for like a perfect I think that does it you can follow us on Twitter and Instagram I'm sure will post more there eventually when I have more time and you can take guesses at the name still just tweeted"
2," I hope we never saw it again oh I think that we're getting really close to never solving it also feel like we should talk about how this podcast is going to be kind of like an 8 episodes on to episode off kind of a thing yeah we're not going to do a little bit and then just some stuff that's like smaller pieces in the Lurch and they'll come back for eight more and then we don't you forget about us because that's the way podcast work is you stop listening for one week and then you forget you're like I do feel like catching up and then here we are without you been here the whole time all episodes"
2," do I mean you really want the answer to that question"
2," do I mean you really want the answer to that question"
1," get lost maybe once if ever"
1," have different we have definitely had podcast where we start"
1," rolling so about 5 minutes and then I can start rolling that's happened like 3 or 4 times"
1," has a lot more out or text her than our last place and this is the the coffee shop you mentioned last time during your epochs"
1," has happened"
1," you know a couple episodes ago we talked about how you had been looking for that old Ford Bronco you couldn't find that you bought that truck I had an old truck and you know we worked on them and whatever you let your fall apart and down your driveway"
1," reason the reason I had bought that truck I felt like at that time I was I was like 25 26 yeah you about that I was an adult and I knew nothing about how cars work yeah it was like it's this Enigma you get you pay a ton of money for it you get in you turn the key you home"
1," turned on to take you where you need to go and I was like I want to do something about that right like my dad you about cars his dad you about car so I can here I am just like someone to be adult with a car with no idea how it works so I bought this 64 Chevy broke down all the time was like a running joke you guys all we saw me you always saw that truck broken down at various roads around Austin"
1," out all the time but it was an immense learning experience in a car with a carburetor that's not fuel injected I kind of know my way around it"
1," in front of your"
1," was a little late I'm about 10 minutes late coming here to the the podcast recording this morning I guess I could rewind a little bit on"
1," so Friday morning I woke up and I had a text from one of my neighbors and he was like Hey I just came home this morning like at 12:30 in the morning and there was some dude like pushing his car and stopping it you know I'm in front of your house and you just left it there he said"
1," put a camera in front of my house like I don't know how old it is maybe 15 years old like 15 year-old Camry just in front of my house to come by later today to check my security camera footage and sure enough"
1," this guy like pushing a car like that sucks Friday afternoon he comes back out and I'm at work you know and I'm like oh cool I see you got a new battery is gone for like an hour or two then he leaves in the car still there that's weird guy came is car still here didn't see him saturday didn't seem Sunday morning I'm going to leave and he's back out there again and I can see he's got a battery and like he's been out there for like an hour or so I'm going to battery out going to take like 15 minutes late something's wrong with the sky see if I can help him it's just like it's obvious you have no idea what he's doing he just totally lost he's like yeah it was the battery out I dropped one of these nuts it fell down in the engine somewhere I can't find it like I tried to start the car to fix part came out I don't know what's happening and like looking at it and"
1," and I'm like I look at it and I'm like yeah you just at you like you're the"
1," the terminals are looks like where your battery contacts like like we've got to tighten all the stuff down he's like yeah I tried to take the negative terminal off like I got my tools right there I'm like let me let me help you out take it all apart and I'll hook it all back together tighten it all up I can't find that nut that he dropped his like the nuts at times though the positive terminal and like that like I looked in my toolbox and I find I can't find the same. But I find like at least I cry because there's not too far away. Just trying to get it running again for him so you can get somewhere where I can get this fixed and I'm liking all right you know I was like it's not a hundred percent I said I mean I wouldn't take this car in the road chip I said but you know this is going to last you for a couple miles down the road I need the terminals cleaned you need to get a new note for this I like they have all that stuff there like I don't have anything you need I was like go down over there turned over there"
1," best I could but I feel so bad for the guy cuz I like I was in that position at one point I have no idea it's just this mystery box that run so I had to help a dude get his car started it started and he drove away not my problem anymore"
1," absolutely Google it but I mean there is some practical aspect to it right away I sure sure you could watch YouTube video but need to be to my not cover hey you didn't tighten the terminals in these connectors enough talk about corrosion or maybe it would cover some of the stuff you know there is a certain amount of hands-on experience"
1," working on this phone and knock on my door I didn't think to go home to try to help him right now because it's like he's got it under control he came back like it's just a battery I"
1," 5:40"
1," we have to run a joke about my truck always breaking down that man what a difference a couple decades of living can have even your going out your way to try to seek out how to figure these things out"

1," and years ago we were making Red vs Blue we do everything we distributed within standard definition and finally you know. What year was it must have been like 007 maybe or 6 we were like when you start making videos in high-definition and we just couldn't figure out the workflow to do it you know we had the capture card but just like hard drive one fast enough back then just like you couldn't write data fast enough to do this traffic codex hadn't really and they were having really mature to the point where you could do this easily so I remember I went over to amplifier for a day cuz I knew they did reproduction I was like show me how you will capture and a code your HD footage and they showed me their like this the hardware we use this is our workflow so I just like try to remember I took I wrote down as many notes I could went back to our office but all the same hardware and then was like boom now we can capture HD and then we made the Red vs Blue out of mind series what are like the concept for high-definition"
1," but if that so that's why we were able to a raid array of like super fast hard drives and it was super expensive okay cool now we can make a high-def"
1," my father was one year older than I am right now"

1," I think the first coffee shop I ever went to an Austin I don't remember the name of it maybe you can help me remember it was on the drag right across from UT it was a 24-hour"
1," nights at work bowling night we used to go to Einstein's in Laughlin instead which were like 24 hour Arcata over there on the drag and we would go down and we drink hot we get coffee in insomnia or get whatever and then go over to like a fun and play whatever video game for out there until like 4 or 5 in the morning and then you go home and sleep typical dumb young kid shit and what if I never had any money back we're wasting time,"

1," calls that don't exist anymore like spinner that was more robust was like these different ways of transferring files and seeking information that no one uses anymore nowadays internet just like apps in the web and that's it and I was thinking about how"
1," different this all is and I was the first time I used the web specifically I remember it very clearly I remember my first time using the web it was 1994 summer probably like June of 94 and I was at what is now Texas state was in Southwest Texas University back in Dallas Texas State down to San Marcos I was at a summer camp and I had been in the back slap which was like a Mainframe kind of deal where you sit like a little terminal is just like a keyboard no monitoring it's all text and super nerdy stuff and moving and over to a different lab the normal and they had you know computers with web browsers in there if I got my check this thing out and like the lab tests showed me how to use I can see you say mosaic which was the only web browser at the time and your he loaded it up showed me is like this is no this is the way I'm just going to take over everyone's going to be using this I was like okay so I got you I was looking for like I do everything for something like research paper are doing a project and I'm like looking it up and it's taking forever to load as low and slow"
1," my mind I'm like if this looks of all these stupid pictures and I still have taken what is it always this slow to be a busy time right now and I look today to the I know this is dumb this is never going to take off people don't want pictures on the internet this is so stupid I could be done with this house in the back slab already and I stood up left and went back to the back slab and I've never been more wrong about anything in my life than I was at that moment to what a fucking insolent little dick I was when I was a teenager like I thought I knew everything I thought I had the entire we'll figure out 16 years old I thought I was the smartest person in the world what a dumb little piece of shit I was"
1," New groups and the Statesman newspaper classifieds to look all that stuff"
1," everything and I feel like I'm wrong about somebody there are very few times I think that's actually part of growing up right like you don't have to be right all the time they're just like strategic times you can be right and I think we have lucked out enough and gotten a couple of things right which soda that we made we've been there when the stars align"
1," about"
1," ocean of the internet like when I dropped out of college and I moved to Austin look at what we've covered almost like I thought this place was going to take off and I felt like early on I was validated and had made the right decision because when we were working at the call center back in maybe like 99 that's when Time Warner Cable started rolling out cable modems markets where you could get a cable modem and I remember working at the call center like every was super excited about it supposed to like tacky people like everyone's like really into this stuff and when Wendy's cable modem is high-speed internet first lost I remember it was 6 MB was the speed and if you wanted to get a cable modem you had to take a class like yeah you had to cuz you is likely to be rolled it out and beta if you wanted to get a cake or do you have to go to the Time Warner office and get to take like a two-hour-long class about how the internet works and how to set up a cable modem and they did not let you share that connection if you had a cable modem you can only plug it into one"
1," if you wanted multiple computers on you that you have to get multiple cable modems soda for a very brief period of time at least you're not so I don't know how to work elsewhere a lot of the co-workers that we had would set up this like proxysoft where they would run the the the internet into one computer and then run like put a second at work hard in their computer run like a proxy router on that computer and then like plug that into a hub and shared almost all the computers in their"
1," Christ and this is like for the first 6 months to a year that high-speed internet in airport high speed internet existed this is like the Hoops you have to jump through in order to be able to dial up but I felt like in that moment when they were testing high-speed internet in Austin that's one in my mind I was like I felt like I made the right decision this is the kind of town where the internet stops going to take off like when you'll be able to test these early here we're to be on the bleeding edge and we're going to let you know we're going to figure this out I'm going to make me and whoever I met in the future"
1," with this like I couldn't do this on my own like we were going to we're going to make money on this and we're going to figure this out working the corner this and you're lucky I meant I'm at the right group of people after I think it was just the kind of place that attracted people who had an interest in Internet things maybe not necessarily knowing what they wanted to do but you know what is similar enough thinking"
1," what they're doing in their day-to-day thing as opposed to prank other people out but you know just something you said before in a previous episode it's like for a long time it was what you call it the Velvet ditch the dell the ditch it was a place where you could get by on very little money and just try to you know do whatever it was that you wanted to do you know try to try to make those dreams happen so I like to that point you know I saw her wandering know when we were working at the call center back in the late 90s early 2000 I started wondering like how much money was I making back that I can remember it was so long ago so I I looked it up but if you can let you log into Social Security website and you can look up the comic money you are in because you know all that has to be reported to the Social Security when you're working here I moved to Austin 1998 in 1998 I met ten thousand six"
1," $2 in 1999 which is the year we met I made just under $23,000 like that was the amount of money that was okay I had a roommate but like I was living here bowling we're going"
1," it's like I was money was tight but it wasn't like I was in Dire Straits by any stretch of the imagination in the year 2020 Goodyear me $38,000 like this wasn't a lot of money we're talking about back then to try to try to make money to then go out and have fun for me the chronicle that's why we would try to find free movies and what go get free beer on South Congress and try to stretch a entertainment yeah"
1," but we go out and have fun"
1," it's crazy to look back at to have that record for you can look back and I try to put that stuff in perspective"
1," crazy curve and would never recover we never slow down you know I'm sure they've been a couple of black financial crisis we're probably going to start at 1 right now"
1," after the 2008/2009 financial crash like it felt like we were on such a precipice of collapse and things change and then within two or three years people forgot about it it's like everything is off again"
1," like to say that it's our fault it's it's definitely Generation X who grew up well you know what they got older and they were like they were looking at making $22,000 a year being like what else is there you know I'm not going to work at Blockbuster anymore I'm going to get mine and I skipped Our Generations fault we learned it from the Baby Boomers you know how I think that you know we saw what they were doing"
1," I think that you know how bad I don't know how much should I want to start here I think a lot of it like the Boomers fault and in Gen X saw what was happening and followed suit so I think it's also to a lesser extent our fault as well"
1," I think it's the internet that came along I think it's it's it's at the tail end of the Gen X generation. Technically on Gen X I don't really identify with it so much internet came out when I was like I mean I start using it when I was probably 1378 you"
1," but I feel like I'm more on the millennial side of it right but I think it would like the information being readily accessible is what kind of changed all of that like whether or not you grew up with the Internet or not and how early it was introduced into your life and how early you think that access like even though I grew up in the middle of nowhere I was very fortunate to have internet access my mother was a teacher and there was this thing I don't know if it exists anymore there was this service call to Texas Educators Network tenant and if you were a teacher you could get free access to it was like an 800 number you can dial from your computer and it dialed you in two like a Mainframe here in Austin"
1," University of Texas rent and that's how I was able to access the internet with no Graphics I like a 2400 watt modem and I would dial into this computer here in Austin on an 800 number and just be like this wall of text"
1," but I mean like how desperate I want to try to access it and then even try to pull up in a small town of like 20,000 people I was Far and Away the first person to have internet in that town and I was the only person to have access to Internet"
1," even though like this tenant think I'm talking about you and all teachers had access to it it was like this very obscure thing no one knew about it like I don't even know how I found out about it so no one used it really and you can't even that back then just got a computer with a 2400 watt modem you know I was like really weird even have access to the stuff anyway I saw an opportunity being the only person Within"
1," the town meant that I had access to research papers I had access to other things people had written and high school if you don't have to if you're lazy and need help getting projects done and for a small fee I could help facilitate I connect you with the information you're looking for a reasonable price to the information that I could get on the internet to other people who who went to school with"
1," need a research paper on the Hoover Dam"
1," play Muse are cheater to connect to a server in San Diego"
1," a lot of trouble"
1," now Canon bubble jet printer and just hand them a stack of papers with the the information they're looking for then it became not fun when I was using it for other people like I was I was downloading stupid chat rooms and look at newsgroups got to be still use mules groups anymore"
1," pirate movies"
1," stuff now. There was no way to buy anyting digitally you know you had to go see in the theater or wait for it to come out and go tinkle I physically you know if you want to see something otherwise fuck you but I remember there was a period in time in those late-night he's where the power to move you to August I don't do that anymore everything on the up-and-up but I remember sometimes we would get that people would post movies to these new groups that were unfinished cuts of movies that haven't came out yet I downloaded a cut of American Pie that had a different soundtrack than what came out in theaters I remember that it's like like"
1," the theater like I was totally different in the song that's playing currently in the sea now probably get the right to edit or for whatever reason like the song the final version changed and I remember this another terrible story we I had downloaded Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace like we had camped out maybe we camped out to buy textbook little tell that story in a second but we can't have to buy tickets we"
1," and I had downloaded it was a really shity like shaky-cam version that someone had a wish you to go to with the shity sick she can conversion of someone had to download it and be like that a bunch of people over to my house and we like Star Wars movie at home it was when I look at the Metropolis Sunday remember I think I think you were there"
1," crank up really loud for some reason cuz I was drunk Texas state troopers ended up knocking on my door"
1," celebrate the possible you turn it down there like something we can hear whatever it is you're doing in here like all the way across the apartment complex and I was like sorry I'll turn it down like all right you don't make us come back out here I would like something else because they're just like the whole internet thing they had the appointment was in the late 90s early 2000 entire apartment complex with wired with CAT5 ethernet so you can plug it in every room you can plug a computer in and get high-speed internet"
1," it was like it was just really crappy run apartment complex that they painted crazy colors to make it seem like artsy is all the strippers with my roommate's room like once a year would flood and it would be"
1," Temple of Doom like all these insects would come crawling out of everywhere anyway they had ethernet in every room and you can plug your computers in what it was like two small low-rent local company that did it and we also ran the phone service in my apartment we still have the land like if you picked up the landline in my neighbor was on the phone you could hear this conversation and my neighbor was a drug dealer so it's like you could just don't you just pick up the phone to listen to making drug deals all day long and let people come in and go in and I knew how much everything costs cuz like I'm"
1," night sitting in that apartment and Montopolis"
1," I was sitting in in that apartment someone knock on my front door and I opened it and if some dude I didn't recognize and he was like hey my name is Jacob or whatever I love you know upstairs over there my roommate said he can eat three hot habanero peppers and we don't think he can he's about to try it right here in the courtyard going to come watch yeah it does look like a courtyard of the Metropolis"
1," the internet for those experiences like that"
1," much do I do remember how much rent was I remember I wish I remembered how much I paid the rent for that for that place I remember it was"
1," Frank he had the the Temple of Doom bedroom that would just be overrun with it's awful to know if you remember this but there was a very brief. Of time where I would randomly get mail from like PR companies with free movie passes really remember one time I checked my mail and it was like it was just an envelope envelope with no return address I will put it in with like two free passes to watch American Beauty at the Metropolitan and I was like who sent this to"
1," specifically lemonade I think it was at your back then it was the Radisson what is it now the line Hotel the second one of the common rooms there and they showed us like storyboards for a commercial and I thought it was so dumb and then making the commercial I saw it like a year or two later I was like a dude getting chased up a tree by a bear cuz the bear wanted is Mike's Hard Lemonade or something I remembered it being like it doesn't make any sense whatever and then you're right at the end of a hundred bucks I like all right if I give me a hundred bucks like I tell him to commercial stupid yeah"
1," what is I could yeah I thought about it was it was free money you know and as I've gotten older the thing I realize is that if you value your time at zero then yes that money is for what is the value of your time and back then for a hundred bucks for four hours absolutely 25 bucks an hour that was 1% worth it"
1," know how to value your time and you don't know what your time is worth"
1," that time we camped out for Star Wars Episode 1 there's a lot of stories"
1," that reminder we should also talk about dudes with the speakers in the van"
1," didn't even talk about like I think it was something we want to talk about this right now actually said that like me going to Japan back in 2005 and that conversation yeah dude we talked"
1," actually does do you want me to actually acknowledge it yes"
1," I'm just trying to get ahead of it"
1," the fact that works"
1," we're right by that you're my butter half"
2," Tommy Lee Jones does Two-Face"
2," as I feel"
2," is nothing"
2," do this episode remotely because I a couple days ago I ran into someone who turns out they were positive for covid idont feel any symptoms I'm still testing negative but out of an abundance of caution I don't get my friend's sick and I don't want to get Jeffrey Eric sick either so we thought let's go ahead and record this episode and make sure that you know we're doing all the right things here"
2," Gus I've been trying to outrun covid 4 over 2 years now if I finally get it now I'm going to be I'm going to be legitimately pissed off"
2," to get covid-19"
2," the pandemic started and went through the entire things and I'm in the running I don't want to say that it's going to be me but I'm all I'm saying is I'm putting genuine effort I put into work like it was like I'm training for the Olympics year"
2," so I didn't finish the story last time we talked I thought about it after we after we wrap up the element I meant to go back in and give a little more detail on something I want before we even get into anything I want to Circle back and close the loop on that we talked about how I like using the internet our first experiences with the internet and you know how I hated the web and I thought it was stupid and I retreated back to the wax lab which is like a mainframe system I used to email a lot of people back then just cuz like it was it was a weird thing to me that you could reach out to the people who disappear like how people email us or email contact like want to know about red versus blue and like you can reach out to people who make stuff that you enjoyed so I would say like I was aboard 15 year old and I would email anybody I could think of and of course they will still need hotdog people have email addresses yet and and I remember in the vax lab if you wanted to email someone at the University you could have typed your email address but you had to specify what server they were checking your email on"
2," yeah so it's like if you emailing me at the vax lab you would email my email address at Beck's live server. Swtc.edu Southwest Texas like you couldn't just do a test wtu was like specific to the backs of anyway whatever I wanted to email someone who wasn't at the University you would have to type like I n % quotes and in their email address in quote to specify to the server that it was an internet email address and that it was leaving the local network and going out to the internet at large what are the first people I emailed was was bungee"
2," I found a bug in Marathon to and I wasn't sure if it was me who is messing something up or if it was the game that was messed up so I emailed like a customer support contact email address the bungee and I never got a reply from a dude named Matt and it was like explaining that it was actually a bug in the game but I found it wasn't me and Lexie just did some work around 7 and I was like wow that's really cool like a fifteen-year-old kid is like my favorite video game at the time I emailed the developer they email me back it's like one of the first email suspension the first email I remember specifically because I was like such a big deal to me and then like 25 years later I was at a meeting here in Austin at a local game developer call certain affinity and I mean with a bunch of people in there like some dude named Matt walks in and he's like yeah you know I used to work at Bungie as like so well yeah you emailed me 25 years ago"
2," I emailed you a bug on Marathon to and you reply to he's like oh he's like oh yeah I just had to leave that was such a beat like a pivotal moment in my life like being able to reach out to someone on the internet and get feedback and I'll reply as I thought you made me interested like a reason I really got into making stuff on the internet was because you reply to an email I sent when I was"
2," out of everyone in the world like I just so happen to walk into a meeting and and he was there"
2," regardless of a baby store. Tell if you walk in the room with me that's it that's the experience you're going to have that's"
2," or"
2," at PAX East he showed up to a boost years ago with hot sauce and life is like a hot sauce and"
2," us I think I filmed that video of your tasty I think I still have that video on my phone of your 12 years ago eating hot sauce in"
2," oh that was that year wasn't it down we were doing a panel a red vs blue panel at PAX East in Boston and you know at the end of the power we showed some videos and your typical pallets up there we would do and someone"
2," then we're doing Q&A and someone came up to the mic and like hey I got a you know a 12 pack of beer I just want to give you guys so I can kind of it too I think I took it I think it was to me and I took it and I put it on our you know our table or doing the panel opened it up and I think I drank a beer you probably drink a beer deaf and panel wrapped up going back to our booth and buy actually by the time I think we have to split up some of us were taking a break to go eat and I have to get back to the booth so like oh wait I think it back to the booth you took the beer but I think it's like for some reason you were going to eat or something you can take it that you ended up like tossing it threw it away. I had to go back to the booth without the beer I show up at the booth and there's like a police officer but not like any police uniform like a like a button up shirt and you know I'd like to look at the badge on his belt and a gun and he's like hey I need to talk to you okay I heard you were doing a panel up in the room and you were giving beer out to minors in the audience"
2," what that mean I do know if you were reported that you were you were giving beer to minors that's coming up that definitely did not happen like someone gave me a 12 pack of beer and I drank it quicker I can do you like okay you be better not be giving up here to anybody like I didn't give anybody the back to scare tactic like they were going to arrest me for getting beer to minors but I never done"
2," know what I mean that's the trash it will be declared give it to anybody"
2," yeah we had we had cookies for a while to baked goods I remember that that's one of the things that I like I look back fondly on it was a ton of fucking work and I hate it and I was miserable at the time but go eat all of his advancing meeting all of those people and especially now after having been you of everything being shut down for the past two years and kind of not being able to do stuff like that if we can look back so nostalgic Leon it when it's a lot of work you know showing up early and working entire day leaving late packing everything up setting everything up tearing everything down shipping it looks like so much stress that goes into that I think as an attendee at an event you know you you know there's a lot of work that goes into it but I don't think you realize the scope of the amount of work that goes into sending that stuff up and doing all that and what long days"
2," the reason we do that if we realized that was very quickly early on that no matter how tired you are and how long the day has been with someone comes up to you to see you it's their one interaction no matter how many people you met that day no matter how many dozens or hundreds of people you see you baby tired but to them it's the one in her actions are going to happen if you're low energy your if your dick or you're an asshole that's the impression they're going to leave with beta there's no like show that person has been in that booth for 6 hours and they have needed to pee for the last four and they haven't had a chance to"
2," one time when we were doing San Diego Comic-Con and I don't know why we had this brilliant idea we only said two people San Diego Comic-Con it was me and Jason and we were in the booth alone so we had to coordinate bathroom breaks and food brakes because like if one we both couldn't leave one of us has to be in the booth at all times and that was, can you come cut already along event lucky top preview night that's what like Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday yeah that's five days of event or you just like I remember being so miserable and Tides there was no break it was just not stopped working with it was a joy to be able to get 5 minutes after I run to the bathroom to go pee"
2," and then yeah I remember one of those years at San Diego Comic-Con Chef you and I work it was like we have been working in the booth and with our lunch break and we like our we got to go get something to eat like I was sick of the food the committee chair let's walk across the street and there's like a hundred thousand people there to eat that will be able to get some some food quickly and we're walking in this like right across the street there's like a train track the right across as like we're all the food is and there's like a Nobu right there and walk out past the Nobu and we looking through the window and it's like totally empty and all the waiters are standing at the window looking at the throngs of people walking by three hundred bucks on Sushi there's like fun it's really weird to think that there's a hundred thousand people here and nobody's going in to this restaurant right there you can eat very quickly if you if you want to spend a ton of money"
2," tipsy at the bar and I think they got rolled out by the steak house while we were sitting in there yeah I"
2," ago yeah no kidding I forgot all this shit is it so much that happens you know we told Erica bunch of things are like always rather talk about that we went to talk about this even me like I stop my story halfway through talking about it in the last episode but luckily Eric's been keeping notes about stuff that we want to we going to circle"
2," a big vehicle to sit around and be Cuts, kind of the temp be before it is before we were right there's a ton of people coming into town all the rental cars are gone so they can eat a big vehicle the only vehicle you get us like ask a lady or a Lincoln Navigator or something so inevitably like that's the vehicle we need to cuz we need to move a bunch of shit around so that's why I end up renting loose end up driving around San Diego blasting hip-hop after hours driving around in a Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade or whatever it was that we had"
2," yeah it's just weird when you get that many people into a town for an event how everything starts to break at the seams"
2," chances are you know someone who smokes I feel like we all have a friend who has been known to smoke in the past and you know it's a good to have all kinds of friends but sometimes when someone smokes if you hang out with them you get the little bit of that smoke smell on yourself and you start the wondering how can I what can I do to at 2 to stop this from happening well maybe you should encourage your friend to check out fume fume is a natural inhaler design for a better super natural way to quit cigarettes no smoke no Vape no nicotine replacement for the hand-to-mouth habit of smoking do you know how to craft wooden tailors in use of course infused with plant boiled study to curb Cravings their flavors like peppermint and Conquer with minty notes to simulate menthol cigarettes and other players like cozy chai and learned very blessed for a sweeter experience and all of their flavors are 1% natural no harmful chemicals in artificial flavors absolutely no nicotine unhealthy about thousands of 5 Stars reviews from smokers who tried everything else and this is work for them so what are your smoker or next smoker whose throat"

2,"I remember we went to we went the one of the first, cuz we are going to Comic-Con in 2004 I think it was the last year that they before that they took over that was the first year that took up the entire Convention Center if I remember right and that's only reason we able to get in a no for what because we've been wait-listed for a booth then they expanded to the entire Convention Center floor so they had a little more space so we were able to get a booth because of it that was when you in that year you have to walk into the convention center to walk all the way to the back on the left and that's why our booth was before they moved it over next to Mega 64 for we ended up for many years and that year we went I remember you and I had a little bit at a time and it was actually so this wasn't so far I think you and I were there in 05 and YouTube was a brand new thing and it member they had like a mixer they're like hey YouTube creators you can come to the I think it's the Marriott bar like whatever that hotel was right next to Convention Center and you and I feel like we make videos like we're not really the big YouTube channel or anyting let's let's go see you know what this is all about"
2," you remember this and we walked over to that"
2," and it was weird because YouTube was such a small thing then that there was no like tickets or checking in or anything it was just like every YouTube channel creator was at the bar at the Marriott and we were just sitting there like it's weird that we recognize all of these people and no one's bothering it would be like if every cop YouTube Creator was sitting at a bar at San Diego Comic-Con and no one was bothering"
2," like now it's a totally different world like that way I can imagine that ever going down or we don't even go into that and that I think"
2," biggest YouTube channel the time was like a million subscribers by the King was still relatively small potatoes it wasn't like a big huge Behemoth that it is now"
2," I want"
2," yeah, that was over fifteen years ago now yeah I'm pretty sure it was okay but remember that first year we went in 04 it was like so last minute that by the time we try to book a hotel there were no hotels left I think we are, Khan is typically in July and I think we got approved in"
2," June so we had to like organize getting all our stuff there and we have to get a hotel room and we remember what the name of the hotel we stayed at was but it was like 20 miles away from the convention center and we had to drive for like an hour to get there do you remember that it was like it was like on a ranch or something you would like in the middle of fucking nowhere and it's like everyone had to get in the car at the start of the date you regardless whether you were working or not because we have one car and everyone have to get in it drive down to consider you would stay there all day do everything and then everyone would drive back up together at the end of that again no Uber or any way to get around it was like you're just fucking stuck there all day"
2," then I would have guessed"
2," to me not that different"
2," what's that story was that kid do you know who was this the parents I just left him there for 9"
2," we"
2," we met a lot of people at San Diego Comic-Con over the years I struggled to remember the first time we met mega64 but I must have been out of packs if I had to guess I kind of messing with Sandra, cuz I think I feel like we knew each other by the time that we moved our boots next to the"
2," snow"
2," I got sick just listen to you tell that story like I feel I feel bad now"
2," if I remember right there was an arcade next door"
2," yeah"
2," me I was distracted I was preoccupied twice twice forgot about that you you're on your site that you can look up it was just"
2," that moment it feels like it's like something you don't expect I guess you know especially those bars for various reasons and then we just stop hitting we got old and tired"
2," just looks like 10 years ago back in again same same time. I guess around two thousand five we were making red versus blue and I remember that we were still got really really small their own a couple of us I think we were still in Burney spare bedroom making red versus blue and even move to the apartment at Beauty yet and I want to say was around episode 50 or so close to the end of season 3 we were just like I don't know what it was I wanted to murder you guys I was just so done with it all we were all just really stressed out with a couple of like long episodes we needed to make and we were just spending days in that room not leaving but I think it's it's at people Me by not realized the amount in the scope of work and overtake it was it was not healthy the amount of work we were putting it was like we bought a couch for that spare bedroom so that"
2," one person could sleep while everyone else was working and we would take turns sleeping on the couch because it's like oh we're going to be in here for the next 9 days with no breaks working to get you know the stuff done and I remember I was like I was so over it I'm so fed up I wanted to murder all you guys during one of my sleep brakes on the couch I like pulled out my laptop and I was like I'm going to book a fucking trip I'm leaving I got to I got to get away from these assholes and I was like I got to go somewhere that my phone doesn't work then again it'll be impossible to reach me and I think I just seen like Lost in Translation I was like I'm so I booked myself a trip alone to Tokyo for like a week I put it like I booked it for like a week or two out and we're going to be done with all of the stuff that's like this will be my reward to be done with this and I'm going to leave you're not going to talk to these fucking assholes for a week and I went to to Tokyo by myself is the first time I've ever been to Japan and like I said"
2," I believe you had a phone from the United States your phone did Dick in Japan and even if it did get smart phones Motorola Razr at the sidekick went to Japan and I had downloaded a a series of images that someone had scanned the Tokyo subway system into a series of images and I put them on my iPod and I could scroll through the subway map of Tokyo use in the scroll wheel of my iPod so I could see like where I was going to wear I had like there's no internet like I had like a little offline map I can scroll through my iPod so I can you where I was going on the subway and I went out there and we we have a mutual friend who's never done anything with RoosterTeeth Steven on a free member Jeff with him and see what's going to to Tokyo and you know I got a friend of mine who has lived in Tokyo for like 10 years he teaches English out there he's like a like a a linguist you know he speaks English speaks Japanese speaks Russian like you dim the light"
2," probably speak to you showed you to meet up with him one night I met up with this dude we go to like a little Pub in Roppongi and we're just like you know some food drink that we just talked like walking out she would like to do like a little bar call to Roppongi and we're we're walking down the street and they these two Russian women walking behind us on the street where is like a big touristy area you know a lot of foreigners if you like 6th Street in Austin and we're walking down the street in Roppongi Endura C2 Russian women behind us in speaking to each other and I'm talking to this dude and he goes hold on one second and we stopped in the street he turns around and in Russian starts like a costing these women are they both like turn white and pale and they just immediately cross the street like away from us as quickly as they can. What's that about you about us I think I don't I don't know what to"
2," that's really cold this guy obviously really knows his language and we're walking down the streets more and we stopped at this one building and he's like he looks as if he ever been our conversation club and I have no idea what the fuck that even is Conoco here and we walk up to this to this elevator and you don't have the other buildings to pan are it's like multiple businesses in like a tall building and it's night time it's probably like 11 p.m. midnight and I we walk up to the elevator and there's like this really big dude standing at the elevator like blocking you from going to it like the guy that I'm there with him to do at the elevator start talking for a bit then like a big dude stand beside you know hits the button to call the elevator it opens up and he reaches into we walk in the elevator the big dude reaches into the elevator which is like six on the elevator on the doors closed and we go up and where we going to conversation club we get up to the sixth floor in the doors open and it's like the doors open to like a nightclub / strip"
2," Club it's always my first impression that I look at it and I'm like I'm going to the strip club with no no no no no it's not like that at all we walk into like to Kostas meets us and you know she's speaking Japanese the dude I'm with his beak in Japanese back to her that I would like a long conversation and then he tried to go do your electors are there someone who speaks English tonight and the hostess like takes us to this little booth it's like a it's like a a booth would like curved couch with Lex very could we go in we sit down and then these two Japanese women come up one more sits on the side of the other guy no one comes and sits next to me and they do like me don't really like you just sit here and talk and I do buy them drinks and still talk to you and you can just hang out here okay and that's why I guess you was at all that I was in love with someone spoke English cuz like the woman who's next to me was like the only one in the club who can speak English too like that dude and the other woman driving like this really long conversation to Japanese and unlike talking to this woman about whatever does like making small Chit Chat and every now and then should be like I'm thirsty can you buy me a drink like okay"
2," I had blocked the waitress comes over and you buy an expensive drink and she sits there and just talk to you we were there for like 45 minutes an hour and it's okay cool let's leave enough bizarre experience I've ever what are the most bizarre experiences I've ever had in my life"
2," she wasn't very it's like I think her her job is to get you to talk right like to engage you in conversation she found out that I was from Texas so she was like oh you know it sucks that's what she drilled into like Western stuff horses I remember she was obsessed with Sheriff's like what is a sheriff what do Sheriff's to do like she like I guess this must be a question that she has had for a long time she was like explain to me what a sheriff is because it makes no sense she must have been picture you like Old West Sheriff you do rounding up a posse getting"
2," chasing people down"
2," is the goal of this place"
2," I think the goal of the place is just me to buy expensive drinks for the"
2," just make money if you bite your buying them drinks it's like all the drinks are overpriced then"
2," guy maybe he was there to lie to her like I said they said I was lucky that there was an English speaker there that night babies to deter non-japanese speakers from going up and like wasting time if they're going to be able to buy drinks or engage like it's not a normal"
2," Barbie there's like a barrier to entry to be able to get in I don't know I don't smoke that there comes right around I wasn't privy to the conversation"
2," crazy I'm glad that I did it and I had that experience as I feel like it's something you probably normally couldn't do it despite the fact it's Roppongi it seems very much like there is a high barrier-to-entry and it might not be something that you can easily do too like you got that you guys have been to Japan after you died there you would have done it and they both looking at me like I'm an alien when I'm describing the"
2," well I'm still here we're still making content exercise aside from that night meeting that dude for the most part I really didn't speak right it's like I can't speak Japanese I was like getting by like under a little conversation so it's like a lot of just walking around in a lot of just like introspection and it was like I think I might have been my first time out of the country Mecca New Mexico for leisure not because we're going to work doing an event somewhere internationally cuz I think I was the only time I traveled International before then"
2," yeah that would have been 05 I want to say May or"
2," we were we spent so much time together there was so much work I don't know how we're still friends and we're still in concert together"
2," stop there was one time when we were down there working in the spare bedroom if you just for reference for people who don't live in this area like to drive down to Buda to the spare bedroom when we were working at Bernie's house looks like 45 minutes each way to get down there number one time we were recording the Wii with gone down with the express intent to record the season to Red vs Blue DVD commentary and we have gone down there and it went off the rails immediately like I was just like I could tell it's like we're wasting our time here that night"
2," and I had like I had I was supposed to play D&D with my other group of friends and I'd like to cancel that cuz I can come here to this and I get there it's like we're just fucking around like this is all the waste and like I just left like halfway through that taping us like I just walked out.

2," the circle of hate and it looks like it wasn't perfect"
2," a lot of work I do not I do not miss that level that amount of work and I think that you know what I'm looking honestly and critically at it I think we taught ourselves bad habits in do not I think it was it was necessity and we had to cuz we didn't have the Manpower or otherwise to get stuff done but I think that tainted our view of work and how much work you needed to do in really fucked up our work-life balance"
2," we were"
2," maybe"
2," you know getting it off the ground and having a war can be successful and I think we just didn't know when to went to let off the gas pedal"
2," already but you know I don't know if I did on this on the showing up it is kind of like what really fucking stop liking he was talking about other friend or the D&D group ice to play with like we don't have any other friends anymore we were just so interested in making this thing work that if you if we didn't see if you weren't making the stuff with us then we just never saw you anymore you we stopped having other friends"

Wow what time is it in the morning I get up I go to my doorbell it's Frank in a full like in full track like in a dress and makeup and everything I don't know why and he goes hey there I got a ride home so yeah what what are you doing I don't even remember but he somehow got to my house at 4 in the morning to get a ride home to my house you would go to bed and you be like maybe tonight's the night"
2," maybe I'll have to go to Houston you know I think it's always great to have friends like that where is it where it is just an X Factor of like I'm in rehab can you break me out and you got it yeah or hey do you want to go get breakfast I'll definitely be late for work because I can't there's a different story different day probably shouldn't a little darker but be like hey man"
2," someone else can you right if I come over to your house and I'll give you a piece of paper can you sign it saying that I haven't drank and you like a sure I can do that pretty sure I think I like they come over they can you do it in this nine pins and different colors can you do sign all these dates and different colors so it looks like and can you try to bury your signature is also a different person I can't wait to hear"
2," another meticulous autocracy animals"
2," no that's very fitting but know if you want to guess you can do that at that animal podcast and you can hit us on Instagram at animal podcast keep up with to date with the show probably or whatever I do to Maritime Adventure shrimp for shrimp and grits"
2," some weird you guys are way too that we should probably come out with merch for the show eventually just enjoy it for me until I came a coffee roaster I would love to have coffee for you I will say please don't message me about that or if you can have a job I can't do either one of these things I can't have the power that it takes start this company so I have the power of zero power somehow I did see a bunch people saying that if we were going to make a shirt so I don't feel like a podcast on podcast in like somebody sit down"
2," but"
2," he's number 10 coming out you do anything special for your daughter over yeah I'm going to shoot blanks"

1," every time it's Barbara and it was fine when you turned yours on Eric I saw you just turned his on and my dad were"
1," just texted up is still fucked up after over two years and"
1," who would do that right who would set it up I mean we never sent anyone to set up the computer or the camera in your house"
1," I thought we started"
1," it's so hot outside dude it's we're having a pre-taped this cuz you're busy next week so we can do it in the morning so we're having to record it at the heat of the day 4:35 p.m. in Austin luckily it's actually not 110 outside right now today so cool Austin summer day it's only 95 outside and the thought of drinking a hot Americano at 4:35 in the afternoon at 95 degrees outside no I was not do I'm not afraid to be the baby on this one no I would like"
1," shity thing I know it's way too hot outside"
1," brutal outside it rain in South Austin you last night and I was so jealous of everyone who lived with us today it stopped at the river I don't know how the renew it stopped in South Austin it was only down there I got"
1," the wind was cool last night so that was"
1," junk frozen peas have a good dinner and then have another bag of peas ready to"
1," as the kids say nowadays multi-piece"
1," yesterday"
1," serious no. Oh God hey dude part of my job is making Tik-Tok so I got to keep up with this lingo with the with the lingo lingo"
1," flop are up here and I can do better I was I was driving around the other day and I was down in there but I was down like in the South Austin area and I drove by where I don't remember off of 35 south of Ben White I-35 used to be like a Walmart in Sams Club over there"
1," then white yeah and I was thinking about how a long time ago we looked at that building after it stopped being a Walmart in Sams Club we look at that building and thought about moving in there as like a studio space like that empty Walmart / Sam's Club and we're like yeah we can make this work in Old Walmart and make a studio out of it yeah"
1," Austin there was like that condemned building on South Congress just north of Ben White that was like next to a bar like the gyms and it was like we toured it was it looked like a set out of a movie where there's like a bunch of homeless people doing drugs and we would look at that building where like yes we could we could we could fix this we could move our offices here we were desperate we were looking at every building that had free space in the city of Austin trying to find a place to move our studio too"
1," yeah we may have to evict you sir sorry"
1," only a smoke shop or"
1," I was down even still there you and I went there once to be in gyms like way in 20 25 years ago"
1," like this little dive bar and us back with Jeff and I wanted to go to Every bar in the city of asean and it was like we'd go by the end of this way or that way and we like it here so we parked and walked in and was one of those places that the bartender had an ice chest behind the bar filled of cans of beer and one of the walls was filled with koozies that had the names of the regulars in marker written on them so you walk we walked in Baden know who we were we don't have a koozie there like what the fuck do you want we just sat there very quietly drink or one beer and left and we're like yeah we were not welcomed and we did not have a koozie this was not a place for us"
1," it was not a place we ever return to that place is even still there anymore but yeah it was it was it was it was interesting was one of that one of the few places we went to that place and G&S Lounge in this Lounge was not hot but we had was for other people who was for other people we'd like some crazy movie type stuff at jannus live is on South First like close to Oltorf just south of Oltorf and real hold the pawn shop to the right now but to the left was it"
1," walked"
1," fuck out of here in Harry situation that the back room and it was like this is like a riot escalation type that we just got to get out of here"
1," you want specifically like this is something we talked we touch. Reported a batch we're like the Eastside was really not you know we have people really didn't go there for a long time it's only fair that we should do with gentrification that you start to see like a lot of stuff popping up there I feel like it you know."
1," wasn't there wasn't much to it back then I mean what not in much of the people went the other was there so you know that you said you know I don't know we still hang out with people over on the east side who would like Brew their own beer shop over off of like Cesar Chavez in Springdale"
1," also back then early on when we first when Jeff and I both first movie we lived south of the river we lived off of Riverside which is a crazy part of Austin to me because you know normally when you go to a city like waterfront property is super expensive it's like really built out condos and rich people living there but remember the damp apartment I lived in that thing we talked about this before but I lived in that damp apartment when you walked out from the apartment complex across the street and you were on the water like it's"
1," Oracle Headquarters now you know it's like it's like Oracle built their headquarters down there but thanks for the lunch I was like I live there cuz it was the cheapest apartment I could find an Austin and there was right on the river. Just the way it was"
1," yeah yeah I've been even like 35 like out by what used to be the Joe's Crab Shack and all that ship has really run-down apartment just west of there but they bulldozed all those and they like rebuilt them it's like luxury what luxury apartments now all that's really really different as well we used to go to a member of the story wasn't someone over there who who lived over in those apartments that goes like West up but it's like cidercade now right is what it is that used to be like a Joe's Crab Shack and I don't want to be some other ship before"
1," step right over"
1," apartments and before you know back when they were they were shity here we knew someone who lived over there and for a while he and Jeff and I work at the call center we try to like supplement our income by like doing the it work on the side just like whatever like if we knew people who needed help by cleaning up above like a small Network or me to fixing computers or whatever like you know which show up and help people out in a little bit of money to either wait till I get a little spending cash Peters once and then never paid us again she had a small business was it business as she got her with a business she did was I can say it"
1," around anymore but yeah we still help them with tons of my teacher so she lived over there we helping with some of her personal computer stuff with her business was over like just east of 35 off of like between 6 and 7 see there's like that little"
1," office complex they're just"
1," into it was a little small for what we needed but her main office was over there and we still go and do all kinds of stuff set up computers and all kinds of things"
1," that was tough do you remember also like to get the help that you wanted like a CD burner instead up in one of her computer's at her office and CD burners are really expensive that we have to get like the scuzzy CD burner and set it up and get it all out so we bought like a brand new CD burner sit up in your computer and like when we plugged it into the computer up there was already a CD in the supposed to be quote-unquote brand new CD burner we're just bought and it was a burned copy of Todd rundgren's greatest hits that was in the brand new CD burner"
1," a CD burner with a scuzzy device over that way they would like to make sure there wasn't a controller and plug it in."
1," fucking needs a city where the fucking needs an optical drive S V yeah that's how much much easier to do much quicker to do"
1," I don't know if I could name three Todd Rundgren Greatest"
1," Todd Rundgren hit"
1," Gus pushing down on that you were pushing down on that"
1," what is the cutoff age for cut your hand off and put it on the scale that's the only way you know for sure we had a lot of time for something to download it like you're supposed to scare away our fists I don't know where we were bored"
1," I still see her name come up every now and then in the news that woman she owes us money still around we ran into her at an E3 at one point I remember that we read it or she was working PR for a video game company and we would like"
1," we don't"
1," so let us know who's the new material absolutely"

1," we used it as a bar in the series crunch time that our stuff released like at the very beginning of crunch time I played a bartender in that bar and so if you've ever watched crunch time it's like the bar the very beginning of a series"
1," someone died I've got them that's terrible about that you know you're talking about all these like small dive bars and we would be remiss not to mention Little Longhorn on that list"
1," and before I talk about Little Longhorn I'm going to do in the side here to 222 Jeff I saw a TV commercial for Little Longhorn last night"
1," passed away like last year so it's not on Tuesdays or something but the whole commercial they never say a word Little Longhorn is"
1," you have this commercial will you keep emphasizing this band I've never heard of and the members of the band and the name of the bar but you never say to take it's unfair that anyways to do the Longhorns been there forever with on Burnett south of Anderson kind of by Houston Street little north of North Loop I guess is on Sunday and Monday's what day do we can have Sundays it's Sunday nights open on Sunday"
1," trying to remember"
1," but their their their claim to fame was to have chickenshit Bingo one day of the week maybe Sunday night maybe whatever they put a big piece of plywood over the pool table and the plywood has Grid it's a broken-down pain into grids and everyone gets money on to pick a grid coordinate and then they put a chicken in a giant cage on top of"
1," the plywood and whatever grid coordinate it's it's in first they went to ever put money on that grid coordinate when's When's the pot"
1," that. I know that does it but I'm in that place we went there before I feel like that is a similar vibe to D & Jim's in that like it's a regular as you do very basic you drink beer out of a can with long horn but it's not hostile at the gym was always just like whatever they would be the place that people walk into in the record would not scratch"
1," are used to say that that stretch of Burnet and northloop we mention this in the epoch episode of North Loop that feel like they retained that old Austin charm and feel but I feel like that section of Burnet is going through transformation currently and it's losing a lot"
1," that old character and I have new character coming in"
1," North Austin kick this isn't a dive bar necessarily but I don't think I've ever talked about this before I want to explain why I have beef with Peter he's here it comes is a local burger place here in Austin and I guess they started knocking and it's like Regional are there in San Antonio and Houston"
1," what the first few Terry's was a baby from them from the start okay so the first P Terry's started as a drive-through down off of like Lamar and Barton Springs still like a little drive through down there and there used to be a snow cone stand in that parking lot cuz I know Beach that I really liked it I would always go to I would be Terry Scott popular they booted snow Peach out of their mother fuckers find whatever so then you know I would go to the snow Beach there going to be snow Beach over like at 34th and Guadalupe in the parking lot of a pawn shop pawn shop close by but I would go down there"
1," if it's there that's the last one cuz they had one over at the fiesta 38th and 35 but then that one closed and they renamed its nobody they just put like bunny ears on top of the snow cone and then there was the one over at the pawn shop but then that one closed was always my favorite snow cone place in Austin cuz they be shaved the ice really smooth it wasn't like that chunky snow cone that you get typically it was a very smooth shaved ice anyway I was mad at Pete Terry's because they booted sno-beach out from that location 3 to go to all the time if anything to a little too small for me that's my big complaint about pieczarek but I was willing to forgive him cuz I was able to help people get my snow Beach else we're"
1," He's"
1," yeah and it was funny to me is I feel like snow Beach result in a mini proliferation of snow cone stands around Austin which is weird because I feel like she wore Casey's predates snow Beach Boys only had that one location like at airport and 51st Street tastes great too but still beats for some reason it hits and they they built these or they had these trailers all over the place may be was more"
1," there's anything wrong with the burger in town this place has been Hilbert's there still a Hilbert's close to our studio off of Cameron really really love hillbrook 26 they have been around since the late seventies I think if you eat at Hill Brooks I've got like a little you know our story things that are they put on the tables inside the restaurant it's like their goal when they started was they wanted to invoke that feeling of like going to your"
1," you know you're free at your at your childhood friends house and his dad's out on the grill you know Flippin burgers and you feel like that's like the greatest burger like being a young kid and hanging out just having a burger in someone's backyard that's always liked the field or try to evoke with their with their burgers and I think they're really good really good Michael put mighty fine until Brooks laich neck-and-neck for best visual but still a very basic I don't like complicated Burgers I don't like her like a hawk. I think overcomplicate burgers in my opinion but anyway but the Pete the time was that Lamar like what kind of be like Lamar and 30th or so and that's the place I first went to Hilbert and I would always go there it was like this run-down old building there's like a tiny dining room up front that's where I first had like Frank's Red Hot Sauce they would put it out there cuz they serve they serve Wings to little Frank's RedHot on my burger"
1," when I talk about how this pot I like the Audio Tech Service Podcast this place had like physical texture like you could feel like the years of up like love and toiling and work hard work that has gone into in this place you know what's in there now they bulldoze that Hilbert's do you know what fucking P Terry's there now"
1," second location for PT Terry's burger place in town they bulldozed the fucking Hilbert's and built if he tarries there a little West they moved over like west of Lamar and there's like a little shopping complex by the Randalls over there it was like an old Taco Bell."
1," but they had to leave that now there's another a different old Taco Bell off of Cameron close to the closest RoosterTeeth close to our studio at least still around but my favorite Hilbert location got bulldozed to make a fucking Peter he's"
1," really, really is interesting because they named it that as an homage to other Austin businesses jilbertos named that because they named it after Hills Cafe in Bert's Barber"
1," Hilbert is an amalgamation of two other restaurants they just took two restaurants with a light match the names together as I go Hilbert and burgers I have no idea"
1," where to barbecue it when you were actually here at the time barbecue used to be over by the university off of MLK like at the southwest corner of you with your daughters that fire station across from what used to be a Taco Cabana I don't know what it is now like off of MLK HEC on the North side or condo to see if they're not there used to be a Bert's BBQ that's what Brooks BBQ used to be it burn down like 10 15 years ago now may I feel like I read in the news recently that they reopen like I think they opened a new location like in the last couple months they may be back but it's a place that's been got that was gone for a long time"
1," 15"
1," they did anything wrong necessarily with the food at Hills Cafe right it's just like it's a chicken fried steak it's fine it's nothing it's nothing fancy you know maybe under Caesar and maybe the same way I don't know maybe that's just like that style of cooking not my cup of tea every now and then Hills Cafe for some reason when I worked at that other company Downtown we just drive down Congress to go to Hills Cafe every now and then I don't know why we ever did that"
1," and flavors"
1," how do I post a different approach compared to Black Hills Cafe or threadgill Square they didn't season everything they"
1," to Max do you remember right in that area a little east of there that's food trailer Kinderland"
1," hinderland was so good that place has probably been gone twelve 14 years now and we're just moving will be back and they never came back do you remember"
1," tenderloin man bites dog bending moved over to the brick-and-mortar and then they went away"
1," set of clothes for the Recently but tender land was a you could but these all these old was pork tenderloin sandwiches but they would take the tenderloin and they would hammer it out so that it was like bigger than your face you jack those sandwiches the bun part look ridiculously titles look like a tiny hat on a giant head and the tenderloin itself fucking massive and it was so good I guess it's like something to do in Iowa or someplace like that I think the only 45 Mi or something that's like like a kind of food that's really popular up there and they would sell it you know from the trailer here for a while and I would love to go to that place it was so if I miss"
1," or what but it was it was your mom's that's what it was called yeah that's what it was yeah okay yeah I thought about that place since we went there whenever that was back in 2008 2007 maybe yeah your mom's work except they had like speed they would make a thing where they would give you a burger but they would put the cheese inside the meat Patty so they want it cooked meals like milk"
1," she's all inside of the burger you like it wasn't out spilling around so it's like a pocket of like deliciousness that is really good for a couple years"
1," yeah it's not a failure thing the other is just like you"
1," now we can do that too"
1," had their feel like there's no like place that's like like go to any more like a Chicago style hot dog and now you're more open for many years but now the Frank's gone. I think there's like a bug trailer down south call like Wrigley dog or something but I haven't been there yet"
1," here they had a bad habit of not paying their taxes"
1," been open a hundred years maybe that place has been there forever it's like over there close to like Texas Chili Parlor"
1," I just always Associated being like in that area it's really weird that those businesses are out there a Texas Chili Parlor and other ones places that that's been there forever and like that place shows up in movies and TV shows and an iconic location do you ever go there"
1," if I got I got I got no beef with them they didn't take my Hilbert's away so they're finding my book"
1," yeah so they had bowling in 1866 I"
1," know why but you talking about Schultz's beer garden made me think about the Green Mesquite"
1," yeah used to be a barbecue place over on Barton Springs Road I never thought the barbecue was always very mediocre was never very good"
1," why how question I like there"
1," years ago once years ago we were eating there with me Jeff I think your ex-wife was there Frank and I remember who else there might have been other people there as"
1," offensive to you"
1," call the trade you wasn't there we were there that you like showed up and like I said I never really cared for the food there but you can order a Shiner beer and they would give you like a giant Frozen glass in the polo finer in it so it's like really cold really Frosty's like I'm going to drink beer and hang out here so I had a Shiner with me and I was I was drinking this beer Frank shows up sits down or like a picnic tables I'm sitting on one of them with Jeff and his ex-wife Frank across from me since down look in my glass and says what's that really doesn't"
1," but I guess this beer looked so enticing and delicious that he raised his right Pinkie and if they are stuck his right Pinkie into my beer took it out and then sucked the beer off of his right Pinkie and I remember just feeling like heat rising in my body"
1," to my head like anger and fury and just looking at him going what the fuck did you just do it was that look really good I wanted to taste it and why did you stick your"
1," made him buy me another one like I threw that drink away I was like what the fuck is wrong with you"
1," dog I'm kind of a germaphobe I'll admit it like a watch Frank come in off the street and stick his dirty ass pinky into my drink into my beer and just like lick it off his feet like I was not having that I was Furious I was so mad that"
1," you were screaming at them it was like sell"
1," but I might be the only memory I have is a green Mesquite the only like concrete this thing happened to find out it's still open"
1," I think we're just very spoiled cuz there is such a big barbecue Coltrane special like Yeah Austin BBQ Franklin course it's great but like the big Center of like brisket BBQ culture affects Health East of Austin out in Lockhart we got places like Crisis Smitty's Black's BBQ latches overrated"
1," above everything else I've been taking piloting lessons for a while and when I was like fruit learning how to practice I would do a lot of lightning over at Lockhart and in the Lockhart airport they've got a sign right next to the runway that says barbecue capital of the world Lockhart 50r which is the airport code BBQ capital of the world"
1," no up Northwest"
1," Intergalactic ore galaxy galaxy barbecue or"
1," believe"
1," that's kind of far from here to drive out there you can eat seafood at the Oasis"
1," service either do the Russians are still open we bashed yeah"
1," also ended up on Burnet it ended up on Bernadette closed yes I knew musical Adventures that we said"
1," that's a good one"
1," people at work I started pulling me aside and say hey I've got two guests can I tell you do you really want me to tell you right now cuz he'll be really anti-climactic if you like you just pulled me aside in the hall and you're asking me right now it's okay with someone at work. And guess what it do I have to report back to us"
1," I'll do that oh"
1," fucking kidding me dude"
1," well this is a great episode of this podcast I love doing and my end and I was kind of like looking forward to it all day so this is a fun way to cap off a little Friday going into the weekend you guys have any parting words anything to leave people with us as we wrap up this episode keep all your blinds closed because it cuts the power you're going to need to keep it as dark and cool as possible in your dumbass Isles it's a good call"
1," well this is a great episode of this podcast I love doing and my end and I was kind of like looking forward to it all day so this is a fun way to cap off a little Friday going into the weekend you guys have any parting words anything to leave people with us as we wrap up this episode keep all your blinds closed because it cuts the power you're going to need to keep it as dark and cool as possible in your dumbass Isles it's a good call"
2," 11th episode"
2," talked the last"
2," I don't think that would happen"
2," Joe's Coffee Anderson you come here"
2," thought that's what you didn't like about flight path"
2," life of a coffee shop without the actual"
2," I like them is not nerdy is that what you're saying"
2," or just communicate"
2," so we are I don't know if we've actually done any episodes in this part of town are no recorded are like a testing for a go at the place down the road trip your work on Anderson we're not too far from the Alamo Village trip we're just down the road from here which"
2," was the second Alamo ever the first intercourse is downtown it's not there anymore so I guess now what's the oldest Alamo that's still in operation and I still remember like when the announcement when they announced that they were an open up the second location to know if you remember this but they would play these bumpers at the old Al"
2," downtown where it was like Drafthouse Henry was getting up on a ladder and a member of the old sign for him put up the letters it's in Alamo on the Marquee out here cuz it was just the Village Theater like all that's the second location they can have it up there at the Alamo Village and it's weird to think like in those early days like thinking about the album specifically made me think about Drafthouse Henry likes to think about like the the faces at the Alamo have the personalities that they had controlling or not controlling but as like their marketing driving that you're driving a lot of the messaging for the Alamo and you don't think they've grown so much obviously you can't scale that like oh my God I think about Henry and you know we used to hang up those like a window in time we would hang out with him"
2," was always a personal trip to think back like that first time we played Halo to like the official launch really stop your hamster without his house yeah you got a copy of it like a day or two before the street date because they were doing something at the Alamo with it was like a big deal went over to his house and hung out I don't know where was somewhere where the Eastside I do know it is actually yeah"
2," my whole like I love these stuff yeah they were doing like a lot of promotion for it back then it's just it's just weird all those memories thinking about"
2," this area where it is between two other areas we've mentioned and you met right now like that North Loop area and also like parts of Burnett Burnett have a changing a lot like this between that like connects all those other parts of town it's like a ribbon that runs through Austin of that but when they announced that they're opening a second location being puzzled like what the fuc location what's what's the point of it not realizing how much better it could be was just"
2," that one screen in a flat the room was totally flat and it was it was not an ideal experience at all like here that's that multiple at the Village have multiple screens they also show newer movies in addition to just you know a specific old programming like they really did at the the Draft House downtown"
2," that"
2," I started so I've since we've been doing it for a few weeks now whenever I drive home"
2," whatever I'm driving around town like something I like think about until I parked like when I get home and I have to make a note of it on my phone but something to potentially talk about four examples of the day was driving down Lamar my clothes to it over there by 6 in the morning and passed by what used to be a steakhouse"
2," to talk about it was the. Of time where even though it was a GM Steakhouse the sign outside to G&M Steakhouse it was two restaurants during the day it was G&M Steakhouse and you go in and whatever"
2," and you know at the end of dinner service at the end of the night it would close down and then at midnight it would reopen and it was a place called Ruidoso sliders and it was just like this dude named as we do and he sit there and eat all they did was make sliders you go in order like six sliders or whatever you say 32 men was fucking delicious it was only open from like midnight to 5 a.m. or something"
2," six of them are kind of a text to Waterloo records"
2," was not built like how it is now"
2," but wonder why did last night what happened was I believe the people who Ranch and if Steakhouse off how successful he was then they didn't renew his least then they started opening at midnight to try to sell sliders and no one ever went back I'll really yeah that's"
2," lots of time to think on the pulse of Austin was so much"
2," fun place like Rito's you know Jason was a good clue you into also if you were looking for a place to live or a car he would help you find it did it I know that sounds weird but Jason could find stuff in Austin"
2," listening but that reminds me also I know if you remember that you never had to deal with this person but there was this apartment locator in Austin who I used a couple of times back before I bought a house and he was one"
2," the strangest people I've ever met but she had this uncanny ability just alike in talking to you and getting to know you to figure out exactly what you wanted and where you wanted to live like you would get you did in his car and his car was like listen you what you would get in his car this whole story wild card look like a hoarder lived in it there were like papers all over everywhere in the car like real estate contract at Lisa's and everywhere is like a file cabinet explode in his car and she was you would start driving around Austin and he would just start talking to you and you would have a difficult questions like where you want to live how big of place do you want supposed to look how long you lived in Austin what kind of car you drive to take all this stuff you drive around in his car for an hour aimlessly I think she would like be looking at people and you know you would stop at a red light and I'd like a like a homeless dude holding up a sign he liked that guy sign changed it was different earlier that you would read it out loud. Okay"
2," place for you any dry straight to it you'd like this place is awesome this is exactly what I wanted to surprise I want this location I want everything I want if you like one place and do you have to drive around talking to the dude for an hour but then after an hour if you like this place is amazing absolutely want to live here and I remember how many departments did you find that too but I remember I also referred Monte to him when Monty first move to Austin in what is was very much like let's get this over with like no-nonsense kind of guy and I was like listen you got to drive around sky for an hour waiting to find a place for you and"
2," that that's why I said it up I was like you got you got to have to get off to go to this process and then like the next day Monday came to work it was like you're right I just for an hour"
2," if you have the supernatural ability to help you find exact even if you didn't know what you were looking for just in talking to you but her presence, since I'm ever like I said I found two different places with him before I found the first one then like three years later city of Southlake city north of infield okay like 3 years and then I called him again for the new place and you still remember do you like to pick me up if I owe you still have that blue truck you know how your pets eat everything he remembered everything like 3 years later after I want our conversation"
2," but I was driving down the street randomly a couple years ago and I was like he was out front of my house water"
2," not too far in that direction right over here you just"
2," to live and it's not like it was a nice car it was it was like mid-90s Camry like nothing fancy like I mean nothing. Like it was like a shity car and it just like it was a very forgettable very plain car just filled with tons of real estate paperwork"
2," anymore for sure every apartment complex is a luxury apartment what is that mean anymore it's not a luxury apartments at this point is it like a place that isn't"
2," name on it and his luxury apartments because the fuck"
2," dinosaurs are we are we are absolutely dinosaurs but we talked about it even back then you know we never at the time when you know we never we didn't understand why people felt that magnetism in that pool to go to like LA to get shit right out for that you can live by the time you can live cheaper a month and we just stay here you know and just kept making our stuff here as opposed to moving out somewhere and you don't get it out there and give him a call it's a lot easier to make connections and"
2," a really really small town there's no way I can watch small independent film there before me was a lot more than I wanted to come here and do something on the Internet and did not have enough money to move to California where you know"
2," all that stuff through the copyright on do you know make it happen in Austin growing up like where I live growing up it was such a small town the closest like real city was San Antonio is like a two and a half hour drive away and send it was fine to drive another hour up up 35 and you're in Austin I like I would like a lot more I was born here and I don't really like some very vague memories of her being a little kid but you know I would always drew me back I'd always visit when I was young and my favorite thing to do when I would visit often as a teenager was to go to Half Price Books which I thought was the greatest store in the world if I could stock up on D&D books super cheap that were used and take it back to Eagle Pass cuz there was no way to buy them down there a way to get anything right I needed a much cheaper price here"

2," spend a lot of time their back when was at back at my house between jobs or maybe when I was working at the the place downtown before"
2," after cuz I would like it was a traveling job in my days off for Tuesday and Wednesday so I would go down like in the morning in the summer and I would take like a computer book to try to learn something and just like lay there in the Sun and read just kind of showed up at her job that got to do with your place to get like better page 2001-2002 since I've been down there a Barton"
2," a Polar Bear Plunge in"
2," guess I guess"
2," to go there like I hated it on the weekends we get so crowded but that's why I would go with Mike this is my weekend was Tuesday and Wednesday and less crowded"
2," it was a ploy to just like be outside you know without having to deal with a huge crowd of people yet a lot easier"
2," you've been welcomed already done so we were talking about apartments in apartment locators and luxury apartments earlier and it made me think about something I wanted to bring up years ago when we worked at the call center we played in softball league Municipal softball league the city ran it and I was down at Creek field which is like off of Pleasant Valley just south of"
2," we played with participated in that league for two years and we never want a game we can't really close one time we were winning and we blew it in the bottom of the inning of the last inning and we lost but that complex back that back there that softball or that baseball complex was a lot bigger yeah two or three addition for"
2," huge and they bulldozed most of it to build apartments and then for the funny thing to me was"
2," after they blow up when they built those apartments they called in the ballpark and I feel like if you weren't here and you don't know that's the story behind it you wouldn't know that's why they call those apartments the ballpark it was like the dumbest thing to me like why not call it literally anything else because like their fields that are left aren't even really accessible from those apartments yeah and they're tearing those down now anyway yeah they're all empty now and they're going to build like mixed retail and apartments down there so they're going to bulldoze out those apartments that have only been there for 20 years when he hits that knows it's been probably 20 22 years and look up they haven't even been to that I'm going to bulldoze all of them and build like rebuild everything there"
2," yeah"
2," out cuz I was going to bring it all"
2," Champion champions"
2," no I think it was like Home Improvement"
2," shoot I want it I want you to sandwich of Champions I"
2," right next to"
2," I'm trying to I'm trying to look up and see what Champions was"
2," prove it was like an orange font with a orange and red yeah"
2," man that's awesome"
2," if it's funny when you see a building that you think should be one thing and it's not"
2," so there was there was a restaurant where I can receive those frozen dinners got their popular back in like the 60s 70s Nighthawk Nighthawk frozen dinners"
2," they had restaurants restaurants and there used to be a couple of them in Austin and I don't know if it's an awesome company or what but I believe the last one was the frisco was a Night Hawk restaurant and years ago before we lived getting back in the seventies they were down on South Congress then they moved where were they moved somewhere else on Burnet or whatever for the Walgreens"
2," it's now like at Burnet and 2222 at Walgreens had to move some they moved over here kind of by I don't know why that Mazda dealership"
2," and it was like this old Diner kind of place that served food that you would you could see being a frozen meal but I used to love that place but I was worried about it because the clientele was all like a two-year-old"
2," you would go in and I be like man I'm the only person who and they had grape pie tons of like real great like diner food you like chicken fried steak or you know whatever and they were they were out for years probably since the forties"
2," and then just who was it like 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic they finally like shut down and they're gone now that was as far as I know that was the last time I talked to call the frisco Frisco Steakhouse us a really cool sign and like just like this old piece of History that's just gone"
2," like a whole pie or slice of pie"
2," jerk you know or like a like a little paper hat on his head you know asking if you want a malted"
2," then they would like"
2," it's really bad habit I don't know if you remember this day they were great great that people had a really bad habit like they were very clean with that place yeah but that a bad habit of like wiping everything down would like some kind of"
2," like I feel like my straw always smelled like Clorox"
2," experience except I could sit at the counter"
2," or its place like that like owls and Frisco where the clientele is all really old the staff is all really only like oh man I see the the writing on the wall for this place I don't know how much longer it's got one foot in the past kind of stuck there for better for worse yeah it's not going to make that transition to whatever is next"
2," guess"
2," but that sometimes in the context of RoosterTeeth and about how we'd their stories and history to the company that we take for granted cuz we've been here the whole time and stuff that we may assume they know they don't necessarily know or stuff it's just been forgotten or lost to time yeah like I was thinking the other day that's beautiful audio text you from that moped today about how we had this big fight back in the early days only things back like 5 or 6 maybe isn't the fight we had a big fight because when we first started we didn't have any banner ads on the website and I was I was very firmly against banner ads I was like dug my heels in I hated seeing this still early enough on the Internet or like banner ads were really trying to proliferate and I hated seeing banner ads on websites I did not want them and I was like everyone trying to argue with me to send me just holding out me like no absolutely cannot have been harassing the website like argument went on for weeks"
2," and finally you know of course you know everyone else obviously that way I can be an ass. Everyone know we can try that"
2," God you did not want to deal with that she don't want to deal with that shit's but eventually you know cooler heads prevailed in the websites but there was a drought that we did we said we're going to put Banner out on the website but if you're the first met with your sponsor of the website you can have a banner out on our website to you can just submit an image you want for the banner ad and a link and will manually approve them and 10% of our banner ads will be Community banner ads for years like 10% of the ad you saw were from the committee for whatever you know a thread on the floor on that you thought was going to be like"
2," or whatever you know and approve them but I thought it was a great compromise I think that's the kind of thing I think that you probably don't remember anymore what is it one of the things that's been lost to time that probably we don't even really think about anymore at this point cuz it's been it's been so long"
2," full time job to look at all of them and approve them on top of every other full-time job we already knew"
2," how's the time you had to do it all the time to go to the we"
2," there is a lot of things like that and I've been like I've been trying to think of points to hit like stuff that may be forgotten stuff that you know we should talk about our discussion now with the added bonus of more time you know maybe we can look back at some of the stories and expand on them talk more about them absolutely if you want to but the time that our website got erased on Christmas Eve now why would we cut that okay with you know when we were in the one-bedroom apartment down in Buda we had all the stuff going on like for example if you know the approving the banner ads and whatnot so we relied heavily on like Community moderators like on the floor and everything to help make sure everything is going in okay Direction and"
2," we were I forgot what it was it was like it was December it was like the 23rd or the 24th of December and we were like crunching to finish and episodes were like once we finish this episode of Red vs Blue will be able to take a couple days off and you don't have like a little too many Christmas break and we were like finishing up the episode and then Gavin starts Imes and it's like hey something wrong with the website stuff's getting deleted I don't know what's happening and we going we look and one of our moderators I just like lost it and like I figured out how to go in and delete everything on the website"
2," out and it was such a fucking"
2," get in there and then lock the other person out part way through as like all the stuff was happening and you're the person who did all this was like I just did it for a laugh whatever y'all have backups no big deal if it was a it was a huge big deal"
2," company would like all of this Autumn and it's like no now I have to sit down and go through our backups and figure out what has been deleted what hasn't been deleted try to merge this database like find all of this shit it was like another day or two of work get everything back online like it's not lol it's funny like now I don't have Christmas this year because I have to fucking fix this shit that happened it was it was such a betrayal of trust that was on the exportation of like this bug in the website that existed where you know who that person was able to do that and I never forgot I still so fucking angry about that like you all talk about dreaming bigger cuz I still get so fucking a"
2," healthy be able to take time off yeah"
2," like a week off for my honeymoon I had my sidekick at the time I was still log into the server"
2," fixing ship Beyond stopped the entire time I was out of office at week like I had to take the website up had to keep things running is a shitshow for me my Emily Mcbride without him buried someone who can do this and who is way better at this than me who still works with us"
2," about"
2," have no apologies cuz they're not necessary there's no need to defend secret cuz she progresses the best of us everyone should aspire to have that level listen when you treat everything as a secret nobody knows what's really a secret and what isn't"
2," it let's listen I I wish I had the energy to still keep that kind of stuff up because I thought that was great I just treat everything like it's the most secret"
2," secret is he has no secrets"
2," see if it's brilliant"
2," is no there is no need to defend there is no defense it's not necessary"
2," a"
2," I've always been like whenever we found my back and stuff or whenever we do stuff for the company I've never been shy about like taking my clothes off for being the fool or be the asshole or whatever because for the most part I try I try to do this much pain I don't let anything I've done embarrass me to say this back when we both drank and we go out with the Appleton public and you know what people like all aren't you embarrassed by the things you did while you were drunk the night I did it I'm just going to own the things that I do and not feel shame about that was a very very awkward when I was"
2," I was always very embarrassed about a lot of things so that I think I've reached a point in my life in my early twenties I said I was going to own it all being embarrasing I am who I am who cares I'm just going to own all the things I do and that's me and I think that's the secret gas is a side effect of"
2," which is just a general no no no"
2," it was a great one on the rooster teeth website extra crispy wrote the wig Us in his four previous episode of the weakest said animal all new materials all the time despite everything we know about the title that's far I thought that was him seeking it by us"
2," can also get the episode of day early not only on Rooster Teeth but it would ever listen to podcast hi"
2," mind when he said that if you said but you can I start thinking of a plaid materials and start thinking of national instrument and I start thinking about like other"
2," it is really started going out"
2," episode. What happens if you had two months notice it should I was going to be out that week notice and then like the day before you like oh yeah you're out aren't you have that's right"
1," away is that a bad Omen that it's bad luck bad luck numbers or superstitions or anything like that"
1," night at Social Distortion I think that's superstitious it is is all stupid like you get an elevator and there's no number 13 like what does it matter the 13th floor"
1," because it's confusing"
1," reason you should be scary and don't break does not dictate your life School the number one the number three is right behind it it's going to get you know stage 4 cancer I thought I"
1," work"
1," and we're going around the corner with the chestnut pocket park like a bunch of city employees like cutting the grass and like leaf blower stuff I thought we can get some great audio text you but right as we started recording they left however there's a beautiful fountain that hopefully gets like a little babbling brook or hopefully you can hear it I don't even know if it'll pick up on the audio"
1," it"
1," Gimbels Park I don't know hundreds hundreds of its this number but"
1," for you and there's a plaque over there I guess it's parked as dedicated to someone probably cuz I used to live kind of clothes I'm hesitant to say cuz I don't want to live where I live but I look by like a little pocket park for a while and the neighbors were always so proud of it are you"
1," proud of it and it was like it's it's it's like someone half of someone's front yard"
1," cuz they loved it it was the best park in Austin so stupid I don't know it sucks"
1," you would have been a little lost in the sauce is"
1," coffee"
1," do you want to write in your diary for that"
1," so it's a 24-hour Comics challenge"
1," it's fine I'm Familiar Taste to it I can't place it I feel like they use the same beans are very similar coffee somewhere else"
1," this is reminiscent of coffee I've had somewhere else to show"
1," what is it is it Stinson's"
1," maybe it might be it might be Nathan Kahn for these extensions"
1," Rosso did they make fun of me cuz I got excited it's fine maybe genuine"
1," pajamas"
1," little peek behind the curtain the place where we're going to record and outside of your diary was closed so I walked outside to kind of try to scout ahead and find a place to"
1," where I did 16 but it's so"
1," really close to my friend's house where his neighbor sold drugs off his front porch I can get it out as we as we drove up here to go"
1," just processing"
1," one time I was driving down to Conover to close to where do diary yes I'm driving Southbound on chicon pulling up to the light at 12th and I looked over to my right and there was a bar there I think it's where it might be her dude I read that somewhere right around there maybe in a building of the same system or looked over to my right and there was a bar and they were people it was it was evening I think the sun had just sit and they were at. The bar was filled with people who are all sitting around drinking but there were no lights on inside the bar it was like pitch black inside the building but I can kind of still see that there are people in there sitting down drinking but what is the score"
1," there was a story that we've kind of alluded to a couple of times in his podcast that we never really circled back on and I was kind of wanted to follow up on it again it was the time someone tried to rob the call center"
1," in the middle of the night yeah so we're going back to the call center which we covered in an earlier episode do we could do probably"
1," probably animated Adventure about Jeff destroys"
1," but so was a 24-hour call center however because really dropped off you know overnight so midnight shift was one maybe two people"
1," no cut your prostate go thanks you remember that was the bar side since this particular night where we're trying to start it was only one person working and it was like I believe it was the 12 a.m. to 7 a.m. shift if I'm remembering right the way it worked was there was a to get into the building there was like a door with a little keypad and you would punch in your employee ID to get in and you still remember your employee ID from back then I do if my ATM pin number 80 if I replay number for employee number the door is open you go in and you know work or whatever and we should have to work one morning and the dude was working the midnight shift told us that someone had tried to rob the place while he was there by himself over night and realized what he said yeah you know I was working. I thought I heard someone in the break room and it came out and there were like two guys unplug it"
1," go to computers and monitors and trying to walk out with them so I yelled at them and they took off"
1," we're like what the hell that's really weird but how did it get in here so who we look through the logs of Hulu login is like oh someone put their employee numbers to come in and Rob the place somewhere that we just hired like a week ago showed up and then robbed the"
1," but it turns out it wasn't actually that employ you know we look at the surveillance but we figured out it was that employees friend who he had told the number to so they could show up and robbed the place and that friend is in prison now"
1," some of the we heard and found out some of the weirdest strangest stories about that person and the crimes that they would commit around Austin like just raisin awful"
1," God and I'm hesitant to say too much cuz if he's out of prison I don't want him to come after me"
1," about it that you guys did terrible"
1," level of baldness and Brazen as to just go in like putting in a unique identifier it's not like this is a general number that everyone shares to get into this building has absolutely nothing to me just always such a strange story to me and I feel like you a couple of people to ask about it this podcast but you and I are no I mean I look back on some of the things that we've done some of those experiences we've had in Austin or do you not like we've been perfect angels the entire time and I think back about some of the things you've done it's like these are things I would never do now of course I'm things that despite see your guys in spite like owning everything that you know you do things that were genuinely bad that people should not do"
1," time that we got involved with Celtic klepto Club"
1," yeah I don't"
1," just"
1," fill in the details in your mind is probably better than what actually happened but yeah it's funny I think back to when you know it was a big hubbub in the early to mid-90s when was Charles Barkley said that thing about I'm not a role model for that but I get it it's like maybe you know you're in his case play youth in basketball in our case yeah we were doing nothing we were fucking losers in our twenties"
1," intent that sounds very familiar"
1," but maybe is it"
1," I hear you just sit back and enjoy the ride over here for a little bit of podcasting we know we we talked a couple weeks ago about how during lunch we worked at the call center with your lunch we would go down to the airport sometime to eat like salt liquor for 911 and that made me think about something else we used to do sometimes during our lunch back when he worked at call center it was relatively new back then but that Blazer Tag Place had opened up down in South Austin off of Ben White I-35 and sometimes instead of eating lunch during the summer we would go over to Blazer Tag I just play laser tag for like 30 or 40 minutes and just like beat the shit out of middle schoolers and"
1," chart problem"
1," but we had like strategies we have a nickname for each of the different locations I like we got really really into laser tag for a while"
1," before we have to go to summer school"
1," this really weird if we did it in place until we have two really good all your texts"
1," to get into paintball but we were scared he was going to hurt yeah we got one gun shooting each other if it's okay then we'll get into this"
1," there might be none now"
1," I don't think we even had helmet"
1," each other in the face which is pretty hard to do with like paintball throwing"
1," put it on Mangum road"
1," depending on what team you were are you can have you have like a different quote unquote abilities and different things you could do yeah and at one point after remember they had a tank yes I'd like a paintball tank I believe it was actually what they call I think that the transfer was it was a ferret was like the type of vehicle it"
1," machine gun paintball turrets on the top of it and saw it was like you had to run and hide nothing's going to fuck you up"
1," other forget at one point I think you mean Bernie we're out there in the middle of the night like on our bellies like Army crawling through like a bunch of brush"
1," the morning you know what I'd like sitting like in the field next to someone you could barely see them next to you and I remember all three of us kind of treat each other like hey it's really dark do you think they can see us and right at that moment so one of those get fired a flare the sky and then it was like I could see everything turning a"
1," reflecting off of everything but oh my God we're in for it now we got we got a"
1," by the way bro you just looked up"
1," Starcraft I mean if that helps but so you never went back but I went back a couple of times it was I was I was a lot of fun"
1," event in fact I know if you remember but maybe you were done with it by this point Jeff but"
1," at least Bernie and I went back and we went with our friend who worked at Bungie at the time he liked us with our friend who worked at Bunty at the time he like flew down and went to like one of those events with us down there in Houston but yeah I love that Concept in fact when I don't remember this also someone had like automated paintball tournaments that had motion sensors attached to them oh wow yeah so it's like they set them up all around their base so that you had to have them directions to distract the motion sensors that way the gun would look over the turn it would look in One Direction and you could like advance from the other it was it was a whole deal looks spent a lot of money and a lot of time making shit for this event and they were really into it took it very seriously"
1," I've never smoked but I know people who do I have friends who smoke it's always kind of a bummer when do that excuse themselves outside smoke for a bit come back maybe they smell a bit of that smoke.

1," who you're talking about"
1," can I pick out a scab one of the things I was happiest about but I still feel simultaneously very bad about was when I got to be on the cover of the chronicle"
1," and Jeff did not resist that photoshoot in promotion of blood Fest"
1," I don't know the photographer schedule to come out and I want to stay with me Bernie Matt and Barbara it was like a weird grouping of people with weird props and we did this photo and then like immediately after we're done with someone texted driving with Bernie have compared to things and was like hey we just do what we just did a photoshoot for the cover of the"
1," wrong"
1," how can I make you feel a little better than talking about we talk about Emos and like we spend a lot of time up there on the Red River Imo's read I'm apply full McCabe's bull mccabes red-eye flight next to Bull mccabes was that place called was right next to Bull mccabes like from the streets was immediately to the left and then we never went there too much what is also at Museum right there which we did not spend a lot of time but I think that specifically the one time I think it's just you and I alone for some reason we went over there I want to see what's the red-eye fly and we saw the most adorable band ever cat scratch"
1," they were 15 or 16 and out of there just like giving it their best and you know really into it was like man that's really adorable and Jeff made a joke that after they were done performing at least there's mom was come out sir Kay to everyone"
1," and I used that as an AOL AOL Instant Messenger handle for a long time I am handle with might be take place there might be cake and I thought it was like it was so funny and then two years later the lead singer died of a heroin overdose"
1," they were good and could determine"
1," time we saw cat scratch a try. But it shows you saw Eddie most which is amazing and I'm trying to like I've never been a big music track a group on the moon or no one ever to her down there I think like you got a bunch of Tejano bands in the town I grew up in a sauce Selena Selena if you watch the Selena Netflix show been mentioned Eagle Pass went to that show because there was a riot broke out"
1," a show on Netflix if you watch that 70 show they go to our town and there's a riot and bringing it up but when I came to Austin I never saw however that being said I did in 1999 I went to Lilith Fair down at Southpark Meadows Park Meadows shopping complex way back then it was like a big Festival"
1," the girls dating at the time and I remember there was a bunch of grape was really enjoyed the time like Erykah Badu performed Natalie Merchant Bonnie Raitt Liz Phair Sarah McLachlan of course and I remember like thinking of this is going to be a cool thing I wasn't about to"
1," my girlfriend and it's like it didn't strike me as an unusual thing to be going to until I got there and I realized there were only two dudes in the entire Festival you are"
1," I knew the other dude that was there"
1," it was it was waiting for the other people named sorry Derek look on his face as"
1," to go see those shows"
1," we're wrapping up I don't know you weren't there but I need to tell him the future about the time I went to Elysium with Frank and we ended up at Denny's over there at like m l k 3500 remember to start when I tell it but it's on my notes here too but thank you for writing it down but I'm hesitant to like"
1," said I did it on purpose to piss him off"
1," I have not said whether or not it's in English or Spanish and we have covered before they do dream in Spanish"
1," had to go to consult I did that on purpose I will say in the past I said something a couple of people have gotten really close I'd say like 90% of the way there so if that helps you are not just in the past week someone got like 95% of the way there even closer I was like oh that's my battleship"
1," letters there's"
1," and then there's a bunch of letters in there so it's just they're getting closer and closer so that being said I'm kind of setup for Ferguson's right now in Spanish"
1," people just over and over that make me want to punch most annoying"
1," but it's a good one no Austin makes Austin"
1," on the border and we switch between those a"
1," out of the freezer Knights"
2," so we had something weird happen at the end of last episode we finished recording where we wrapped up we were at that park over by Jerry coffee and right before we start recording at that park there was like a crew like cutting the grass and trimming everything and I was a little worried about there's too much audio texture but they finished I was fine and then we left and there was like a city of Austin van parked right next to the park and we walked by it as we were walking back to the car and like some lady rolled down the window and just like yelled out at us like what your podcast"
2," and I just said Emma and I kept walking and Eric was nice enough to State and I clarify anma"
2," remember"
2," we were how do I add a car I don't know I'm here off of Riverside and I've been wanting to come back to this part of town because we've lived in this area for sale"
2," this is like just south of the river front of the Riverside you used to live not too far in that direction I used to live not too far in that direction that I live with you and yeah so we have like a lot of folks in this part of town from the late 90s early 2000 how long did you live"
2," for three years that I moved away to a different part of town then I came back and live with you for a while"
2," there is a lot I looked around here it's kind of a disgusting story you taught me how to vomit if I drink two"
2," tried over here"
2," we drinking too where we are like I would drink respect that and like I would drink a bunch and I would never vomit and you always convinced me like you just get it out of your system you keep drinking and finally I gave in and you taught me how to do it right over"
2," was like because it's right on the water so you would throw up off the railing into the water and the Ducks are coming to eat it so"
2," there was an open bar and find the correct app for the open bar at a certain amount and we drank to that amount before the reception ended the bartenders had to go to the bride and groom and asked him if he wanted to extend the be dead and then we drank through the extension and the bar owners had to go to the bridegroom and tell them that they wanted to extend the bar was out of"
2," have drank all of the alcohol in the bar with we had a little people there but"
2," they were not happy at all it was a lot of money"
2," very fancy seeing you here in town and we drank a lot of alcohol"
2," flowers"
2," had a bad as you make it sound"
2," got a couple"
2," moved"
2," everything you like I'm looking around like that where we are we're in the back patio is not much of a view I can't really see this that you would have these expenses everywhere but what I can see is all I don't remember any"
2," or next to a Dairy Queen that was here but all this other shit is all new Oracle Headquarters which is where used to be where there was an apartment complex where I lived those The Damp apartment the cheapest place you could live in Austin was like right here and now there's all these new luxury apartments I can see all around us"
2," time and time again"
2," and back before Vanna White was a freeway you just have lights on it down over here so to get to the airport you would drive down Riverside like this is the way you would get to the airport so like that's that's my memory was before I had another job while we travel and I lived over here in the stairs like I remember always driving down Riverside like pre-dawn to get out to the airport going out in that direction that traffic's redirected now area was under construction for"
2," down"
2," joke I remember there's a McDonald's down right there right off of Ben White Grill close to the call center for used to work over how dangerous intersection was like where you would turn you would have to drive by that McDonald's to get to the call center back down where we work if you're coming off of Ben White back then and I felt like"
2," at least once a week one of the employees was an accident right there at that McDonald's to be like why are you late. I"
2," Wendy's sustained me for so many years of the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburgers being broke and it was like I would either order a pizza from Papa John's and eat off it for a couple days and like one or two junior bacon cheeseburgers from that when he's down there but also down in that area like Segway into a little more recent a little bit more RoosterTeeth times it was still there that post office which is the one right down by the call center the one that we went to for your shot stuff out for"
2," don't know"
2," don't generally have like the most welcoming atmosphere but that post office is the saddest and simultaneously angriest post office I've ever been to like even from the outside if you park in the parking lot and you look at it and it's just got this I don't know how to properly describe I would say it's like almost like a A reduced brutalistic architecture look to it or it's like you look at it and you like this looks like a fortress like this place does not look like they want you to come inside you have to go there all the time to mail stuff out when we were in order of the day's receipts like Mailing Store orders or mailing"
2," there and it's just awful I can't believe that it's untouched it looks like something out of the late 70s early 80s and it's just like nothing has changed about it I wouldn't be surprised if they put spikes on the front door I"
2," That one that one I remember there was a I'm not this was before your time at the call center. I only work there like a year before you showed up so it might have been in that time but you remember there was that breakfast taco place while the cops out"
2," okay"
2," I was just like a taco with a face on it and it just had like a bubbly like a Cooper font or"
2," they're not there anymore"
2," or down the street from there was the sketchiest dirtiest business I never went there for like a week I drop boxes by where we work but this was"
2," place was sketchy as hell out of here over this down the road from the call center was this business called mermaids"
2," sorry it was a a hot tub rental place but not like you get the hot tub"
2," could hire a mermaid to get in the hot tub with you bro. What the fuck like it was there"
2," yeah I just like I feel like even though that's not Riverside that's a little further south"
2," part of town has gone under it went from a little dangerous kind of CD to very like Oracle Headquarters yeah this coffee shop like you look around like there's so much change does a condo Place remember these to be the world's most expensive it was right down there next to the liquor"
2," pick up luxury condo First Liquor"
2," went to that store two or three times when I got my ID"
2," Centennial Liquor on West 6th which is kind of by whole food while I guess what it just closed like a year ago I think it's like a a pizza slice place"
2," right by some old Austin institution put your clothes now they were very beloved but I never really liked Hut's hamburgers and Frank & Angie's"
2," was the better of those two restaurants but the thing that I always liked about this place was that the employees always wore the opposite shirts all the way to Fort Wayne Hutchins shorts is going to hunt all the way to store in Franklin and t-shirts"

2," you can park in this parking lot nobody's here and they want to know you can't do that anymore money"
2," was living in La at the time if I remember right"
2," drink it with those the frozen margarita"

2," what about Bethany"
2," got more bandwidth for the servers and"
2," it was like any other day there was only like"
2," zero impact sweet irrelevant quite a few videos for MTV around that time like this little bumpers and MTV to also I don't even know why I'm not have no anything that"
2," bit early days like the hustle like how many little projects them... That's a little pricey but how many like weird projects you take on just to try to make a little more money and see what sticks and see what happens there was there was one year where we made a bunch of videos for the NCAA for them to play in college football stadiums when plays happened on the field yet we would we would see"
2," a bunch of different possibilities of teams in different scenarios in NCAA college football and then if the scenario happened on the field they could play like a Reba quote-unquote Replay that we had previously captured"
2," that there was another project going on simultaneously was that an order for four NCAA and then on top of that I was doing at the time where you like unscrew your top and it's a code you put on the website and if you like ghetto it would show you like"
2," replay of a video game like a football game and if like you if the replay you watch scored a touchdown or scored whatever then you want a prize so we had to make another couple thousand of those videos of getting close to scoring and not scoring getting shut down immediately so we had that these giant spreadsheet that we print it out and you would hand someone a stack of paper be like this is a 300 chart to me to get today"
2," I don't remember this like let's say you're trying to set up a game like Jack and I are playing against each other to set this game up Jeff has a Polly likes to the 10-yard line so my job would be to take control of whatever NPC is closest to him trying to stop him"
2," on my way to try to console switch to the closest player and run him in the opposite direction to try to get this place set up there was so much work"
2," record now that I think about it I don't think it was just to be clear I don't think it was directly for the NCAA it might have been for ESPN or like it was like a separate company"
2," something we weren't working directly with it was like through an"
2," drive it was like we were working on it till the last minute and it was a we got to a point where we can either upload this now or I can work on it a little longer and take it on a hard drive up to Connecticut and deliver it to ESPN tomorrow to ESPN to turn back to the airport"
2," we don't have took that flying Crimson"
2," remember those projects because I got all the sellout marketing lines it was always my job to deliver those"
2," go"
2," Steve"
2," no I don't"
2," tweet we also made the ladies videos"
2," gas"
2," years Ballmer and of course with Microsoft"
2," serpentine belt about to go out"
2," do the guys to get paid to play"
2," I"
2," they would see like the the play why I"
2," 423 we doing commercial"
2," if you look there's like photos me around that time. We have really long hair and if you will ask you like why did you let your hair get that long as I had no time to get a haircut like like not an exaggeration like there was no free Tyler for a year-and-a-half I couldn't cut my hair I every waking hour was doing something I"
2," another"
2," getting notes from someone about your"
2," thing. Video game developers and there was a period of time where we had a bunch of you know game console development kits and like a large part of my job became learning how to manage all of these developer kits how to push out like firmwares to them how to manage like the network of all of us to spend like when we would do the trips to you know and I would meet a game developer do I hey how does a how do you do this or how does this thing work if they would tell me like I do okay cool cool that I'd like to go back to work and like try to implement the things I was learning little by little on our like network of game of all the cops cuz that's what you talked about all that stuff in the football games like you can't do that the stuff we were doing you can do in retail cost of day we were getting like development bills and running them on development hardware and it was just like a nightmare to keep all that stuff straight"
2," I put it in the hands of the player like I made it into much more accessible way it was some of those it was like oh yeah you can't put a new key frame behind an old key frame if you do that the game will crash so it's like if you want to put a new key frame back there in the time-life you need to delete every keyframe back to that point put a new one and then we do all of your new ones I"
2," it was it was like a lot of video game developers are people who understood the system and you how much was not user-friendly at all"
2," terrifying terrifying"
2," I don't remember spending a lot of time at that house I can know what you're talking about but you have to take out there but yet house had like a back patio that I don't think I ever went on to yeah it was like right off the master but it up to the fence"
2," don't remember that at all"
2," but when you just come up with this plan at that point just give it to live under the deck"
2," and spiders under there I would bet a felon"
2," life so stop me if you want me to tell this story there was something Jeff"
2," do when I first met him that I thought was simultaneously evil and genius at the same time if someone cut him off on traffic or like someone"
2," it allegedly if someone wronged him or cut him off or whatever you have to write down their license plate number"
2," go to like a pay phone but people just go around back then and he called the police and he be like Hey listen I'm a parent I was out at a playground I saw this car it looks suspicious I don't know maybe they had a camera taking photos of"
2," and I got their license plate number I don't know if it's anything you can do I just want you to have it just in case it comes up again in the future"
2," and I thought like that is some diabolical stuff and is so fucking smart"
2," did we we we we give that caveat a lot like we can look back at it just like stealing the bottles must be taking the ball to the wrong and it should have been done but that"
2," it's like you're a different person and it's a different mindset"
2," something came up in the news here in Austin recently that I think it is relevant to this podcast there is that McDonald's over on Barton Springs and Lamar that's closed and I think maybe maybe twice to the McDonald's however that being said the guy we talked about how I would go to Barton Springs like on Tuesday or Wednesday in the morning and I just hang out there"
2," one of those days I remember like I left some reason I stopped at McDonald's and I went in to get the Big Mac or whatever and I place my order and I was waiting for my order and my cell phone rings when cell phones with Qualcomm yeah primeco phone rang and it was Jeff and we got contacted by this ad Network and they want to run I had to on our website and you know we can finally make money on the internet and I was like holy crap. That's a really big deal and yeah we're both really excited about it and every time I drive by there. I think about how it like that the first moment where I talked to some of which I hate you can make money on the internet speed blah blah on that"
2," 2001-2002 thousands of"
2," I've been built so many condos right now"
2," the store"
2," in there was a fast there was just one woman in Oklahoma who's internet did not work and is the one time, she was not a recurring character and she told the wrap my family got to the Kennedys don't think we can't get to you"
2," there's like real psychotics. Oh my"
2," coming yeah we have a lot of a lot of drugs and mental illness"
2," yeah they have"
2," lot let me see the"
2," yet so really sad story"
2," listen I'm going to be doing this going to bust out the microphone"
2," really good but not not quite not quite there but guesses come inside I feel like people see stuff and it start stealing it is over and over again like cycle said that it goes through how about Aruba not"
2," but I've got Kokomo"
2," called Kokomo in Mexico across the border from where I grew up"
2," not having stickers on to have a sticker on my face again this week and just this continues it is a preferential sticker treatment I'm glad they didn't let Andrew know that bar I don't do what we did when we were young"
2," not having stickers on to have a sticker on my face again this week and just this continues it is a preferential sticker treatment I'm glad they didn't let Andrew know that bar I don't do what we did when we were young"
1," I think we'll be okay to treat the trees been here for probably four hundred five hundred years we just needed to hold together for another"
1," it's a joke how long you think that she's been there"
1," according to the little tag on it is 5674 years old"
1," so I wanted to you know we we sat down and listed a bunch of cop shops all around town and I wanted to find a coffee shop coffee shop down here south of the river in the old Wharf area because we spent a lot of time"
1," really very I'm good. At work and was like hey let's come up with a list of coffee shops and we can get the office can you send us a list it selfish for me to go"
1," down south cuz we spent a lot of time here there are not a lot of coffee"
1," tops off of Oltorf and this cream coffee was out"
1," yeah. That place is packed that place is hopping and it must be a side effect of the fact that they're really there still aren't very many coffee shops down here I think every table was taken at the park like around the corner because it was there was no place to sit down"
1," we were when we were on that being said when you park here at this park to come over Colby park behind this car and look like it was"
1," do dinner darken it by himself in the car so it's a hundreds if not thousands of times but I've never turned down this job never set foot into this Park which is just an empty lot with sidewalk and a couple of trees"
1," front door behind some Vines it's overgrown"
1," it's I mean like"
1," but if you look down into the girls on his actually signed at a trail down there I think they take me to walk down there"
1," there's that Pete Terry's there and there's that new Whataburger for the Luby's used to be a siphon that everything else looks identical to change but all the buildings are for the most part the same first time I had was right down there me to music and I remember they had a sign on the wall advertising their smoothies on remember this and I love that sign is my favorite I never I find a restaurant cuz it did Proclaim that their smoothies were made from the Fresh"
1," so yeah it's it is what it is. We talked about that it is largely the same change but it's it's it's pretty much the same some of the apartment complexes look like they received some updated paint and signs but they're largely the same as"
1," people had people had like homemade Decks that collapsed and like lots of people got injured and or died our servers for RoosterTeeth used to be right down the road down there on Oltorf like you kept going there kept going down Oltorf to where it intersects Montopolis"
1," at the southwest corner of the intersection is like a nondescript Office Park and is actually a bunch of colocation facilities in that office park because all the color code location like it's like a hub for"
1," our servers initially when we started what kind of spread over then we have them in Sacramento for a long time then over the course of a week and I had to migrate them to Austin so I flew to Sacramento loading them up in a SUV and then drove them all back to Austin and install them down here at Oltorf and Montopolis"
1," I feel like there's a lot of that like a lot of a wink quasi-legal gambling around here especially like what to get to the outskirts of town it's like game room to smiley face Yeah Yeah Yeahs charity sweepstakes like that kind of stuff and I don't know how that stuff stays in business hang out or do"
1," go and do some illegal gambling"
1," Royal Crest"
1," the sound of your nice to take this all the time to come either I go this way or like an Xbox over to get down to the call center which is just south of here and I'm never I've never turn back is a little houses and stuff and oddly enough every house has a sign that says Private Drive I wonder if they have like a problem with people parking in their driveways all that's"
1," that's a good joke a spot that we"
1," I want to say this in one of two locations it was either right here off of Parker make his little north of here on the West side or it was down off of metropolis north of Riverside on the west side of"
1," one of those two I can barely picture the place you're talking about but"
1," don't know if I can pick it up but we're really close to I-35 got a little bit of that Austin traffic audio texture hopefully pick up if you hear audio texture of like a loud crack then all three of us should get up and run as fast as possible into trees falling on us so I"
1," saying. I saw a headline last night but I thought might be a good segue to talk about some stuff here on this podcast I saw that already saw this or not I guess Jesse Eisenberg signed on to do a movie with this"
1," he's going to play"
1," you're Nathan Zellner work with us for years Irish teeth are you supposed to do the bond be a lot of our life special effects work and he was always working on these are you know film projects with his brother David and you never really had a lot of act like they were way more than we ever were and always had films playing at Sundance and it is just wild to see you know them come back up again he knows make make make another movie about Sasquatch they made a movie"
1," already like a variety or"
1," the stuff you talking about here besides Garth Brooks Channel to there's no mention of any other casting I thought I"
1," we are at me. I was I was I felt like there was a period of time where we you know we obviously worked with Nathan and we know we went to Sundance a couple of times it kind of like an audit he's you know with red versus blue and Rooster Teeth but I felt like the zoellner's and the duplass brothers were always there in a day at the new place across from this area and I was always like really envious of all of them because they were getting like the main"
1," stream like what app makes you look like a real critical Accolade I just don't festivals and I think that this film one of their films with our hbx camera with it back"
1," years ago when we still always like kick around these creative ideas and projects that we wanted to make and so we never got around to it this is always one of my favorites and I think I didn't get off the ground so I have no musical talent but you wanted to start a"
1," and and are you want to call it brother versus brother"
1," who both pretend like they're brothers and each song is just talking shit about the other brother"
1," what's my driving that's that's all you do I felt like working you know such fun creative jobs to mind numbing jobs like that's all that was always our out that's how we started making this website before it's just like trying to find that creative outlet and try to find a way to express yourself however possible while doing the most awful work ever"

1," this was to let you know the cheapest place to live in Austin my very student-focused a lot of like working families to install live down here and I think that's still the case yeah it really hasn't changed that much in that respect and I think that's the reason it was so close to work on time my car wouldn't start I look like I said I looked around the corner over here at the apartments and my car wouldn't start back when I started the call center a shift would like three or four people like was really small and I've called my boss"
1," okay you know I can't I can't make it my car is not starting and his reply with can't you just walk and I guess I could like it would take me like 45 minutes or something like it really wasn't that far wasn't that big a deal that he came to pick me up and then I went down and work that's back when I had I don't remember I had that"
1," beige Isuzu pup pick up that have no air conditioner no radio like this really ugly base color not too dissimilar from this table or sitting at little lighter than this"
1," truck I don't remember that. Truck had this really the truck had like three hundred thousand miles on it 1986 Isuzu pup and it was a manual transmission and headers really bad habit where if you were not very crisp in your shifting like to be try to kind of go in a straight line between 2nd and 3rd gear boxes jam up under the truck and"
1," smash the gearbox yeah I would like a wrench to get it to loosen up man you going to the shop to get anyway every one time I was driving here on Oltorf 35 and the truck died and I was like oh no it was like 5:00 rush hour with you know just keep taking off and I looked in the mirror behind me and the road was actually empty behind me and I was going to stack up in front of me really full but like I wonder if I can pop the clutch in reverse so I can let off the brake put the clutch in the trucks aren't really slowly backwards down the hill I put it in reverse and I popped it and it started cuz I owe my God you can reverse and I pulled into the Luby's that was right over here and right as I pulled in Lucy the diet again and I had to like like Let It Coast into a parking spot and parked it then like had to figure out like how to fix my fucking truck that wouldn't work anymore"
1," things"
1," wasn't for example if we went out to get lunch at a Subway footlong you didn't want to eat the footlong or 6-inch"
1," popular six inches and save that for dinner"
1," I don't know how he got there and it does all make sense until you know you talked about having your car trouble and dealing with cars I don't know if you're still this way but to this date anytime I'm driving down the road and there's construction and you know they have the shoulders closed I get nervous but if my car dies right here where am I going to go to the store to pull over for a long time 35 right around here was like that especially just south of here going over towards Ben White and like it was always a nightmare it was always a fear of mine that my car was going to break down and I'm going to be stuck on 35 on the highway with no way to get off of the"
1," motherfuking month do you remember the abandoned car at the parking lot"
1," but his car that nobody took ownership of just one day in the parking lot of the call center there was a car that didn't move it was obviously broken down and it was there all told before the car finally left it was there for probably close to 10 years but it became the sticker car yeah and anytime you had a sticker you would put it on the car and it got to the point where it was more sicker than car is just like this abandoned car that was covered in every band sticker every does like a bumper sticker any"
1," anything in the offense is it supposed to come and get that car after a few years is that all bets are off you in the windshield was just like covered in stickers and I think eventually years later we found out whose car it was and he wasn't"
1," didn't work it was a good take more money then you know it was worth to fix it so I just left it there just abandoned it but that guy John remember this he had we like them a lot of money that I know inside of a corker what your idea John I'm going to go to website and whose idea was that used to be like a poor and middle night that he was going to make a website and license plate and then let people watch born on this website and he would run out on it and he was confusing make him a millionaire you'd already bought the domain for it and everything is ready to go is like we are very proud of it I'll double check I don't know if you wanted any more not realize like what's your what's your website going to be John smut warehouse.com"
1," something you guys would break into a video are you"
1," he was so proud so much money was smartware"
1," bought it back then in a website cost like $70 a year to register a lot of fucking money. Warehouse.com on my iPad and see"
1," I thought I had my my parents gave it to me when I was like 17 I remember they gave it to me and you know I didn't have much either as a cow's very grateful for it got into the cab for the first time since I was a manual transmission I was like my dad was there was like but I don't know how to drive a manual transmission he just looked at me did you learn and it turned around and walked"
1," got it but"
1," all right I'm going to spend lots of time in our neighborhood driving around the block 3 how to drive this fucking truck so that we can go to the Burger King and"
1," I drove that Isuzu pup down to Houston one time Frank was living in Houston at the time enough to go down to visit him write my other one of them by the front door Michael Rubin was up here visiting me in Austin and the river"
1," you came up we were there at the apartment over here actually right off of Riverside and then that we were going to drive with the day he came up like one day he spent the night then the next morning we woke up early going to drive down to Houston and Ruben did not know how to drive stick so I had to go all the way to drive down to Houston and we were tired like we stayed up late drink in the shed or whatever and I was really tired we taking 71 down to I-10 to get to Houston and look on the other side of Bastrop and 71 I was like Ruben I can't keep my eyes open I can't I cannot stay awake I'm falling asleep here like can you drive cuz I know I don't know how to drive stick I can't I can't drive the truck that's okay just what I'll make you a deal I'm in the driver's seat I'm going to close my eyes and take a quick nap I'll leave my feet on the pedals you reach over to the passenger seat and hold the steering wheel and you drive while I took a nap and I start dozing off and I fall asleep for just a few seconds then I like open my eyes and look up and I looked over at Ruben"
1," His Hands on the Wheel but his head back and he's still pretty"
1," we should have died"
1," oh oh yeah I did not trust him to to drive from the passenger seat anymore after that"
1," hi I was a bad choice"
1," or Donohue"
1," close today 1 like I did with one ugly in turn it down and then we were starting up his next project with drunk Gamers I think you'd seen us to make stuff already in the past and I think he was trying to get you if you want to join an early stuff that's what we divided consoles up that used to do all the Xbox stuff I would go the PS2 stuff and you would do all the GameCube stuff"
1," it was really early on in the drug game"
1," all of our really like very first off I don't think he was there at like I think we didn't have a website at that point I think we were starting to make the content and I think once so he probably didn't see that cuz we're doing that like at our houses I didn't want to start working on it at the call centers when he wanted to become involved"
1," the Donkey Kong theme the banner image with the Flaming Doctor Pepper"
1," ever. That was great I loved it and then we used to like a Content management system called movable type cuz like I had to take Jess design and then make it work in this content management system which allowed it to like Post and Courier"
1," archives and categories and everything is a big learning experience for a long time, I set up a movable type website for that but that's how it worked at First until we had the community site like a year in there was a problem we had our first the first time that he like started working with us how you was working very Loosely am I from the call center course"
1," we talked about how I had that website show me the monkey cam I think the first time he started like working so messed up with us when he would put on Kodak if you would like to watch person to do that till I get in and modify like the flash files and you know make things a little different on"
1," cuz back then when we would make you sweat sites we hosted them at the call center I wanted to call center servers"
1," there's no matter what it is that was a cool website. Net on those servers that we would always posting a website was really ridiculous expense especially back then so we"
1," the server so you just become like go super using it as a legit and then fuck with everyone else's website anyone else's work out now you just like Amazon AWS cool it's done all that stuff now it's a way better now"
1," I think it was the Soldier of Fortune 2"
1," for Junk a is like a a write-up about Soldier Fortune 2"
1," that game to his wife at the time he had this"
1," or sit down and look at the superseries IPS and get like their perspective on it yeah that's like you're try to write about that it was it was a really good way to look at it like I would like a very Outsider look at you know something that we all take for granted"
1," I think that was the first thing that he did with drunk a I want I'm pretty sure that was it to two and a half years"
1," talked about this house we would cycle through ideas right just like this idea this idea shut this website. I think after two-and-a-half years we were ready to cycle"
1," we saw where was going it really wasn't get any bigger was going to do anything else right"
1," and so we"
1," and we would go downtown so much that we see him all the time and"
1," we skim off at"
1," over. Like fuck you fuck you fuck you we're done"
1," you were there was one person we were once one person"
1," it's a black and white photo of a black and white photo of a much younger version of both of us look in the camera off"
1," with drunk Gamers we did very briefly experience like an early bit of Internet virality with that site and that was you know one of them is working with Bernie was when we did the apple switch parody which was a video we made in 99 2000 summer of 2000"
1," parroting does Apple switch commercial set head come out at that time and you to pre really any internet video we are going to made and uploaded this video and you know very quickly became incredibly popular and was all over the place and really I think that was our biggest reach with that website was that video which whenever when I still see it pop up every now and then you know various places but that's the piece of content that kind of indirectly led to RoosterTeeth because after we make that like we make that in August of either 2000 or 2001 I want to buy computer gaming World wanted to put that on there CD that they distributed with their magazines but if they they contacted us right after we had done the fuck you think so we didn't have a website 2.2 so Bernie re-exported it instead of saying drunk gamers.com Erie exported to say red versus blue dot, yeah and that was a virgin they put in with the magazine"
1," and that was like oh okay well now we got to do we got to make this red vs blue thing is our next project because it's going out in magazine"
1," I was working at a call center at this time I was working at my at my office downtown and we were going to shoot the same after work and Bernie had instant message me and said I hate you need to pick up a blue light bulb for the shoot we're going to do so I went down the hall and photo which doesn't exist anymore with across from where the Drafthouse South Lamar has a blue light bulb to my warehouse in the warehouse to the call center blue light for this blue light look like"

1," I feel like you don't hear about slamdance as much anymore as you did Mel this is all stuffy and RC and slam dance was like you know a lot more of that like Renegades it wasn't it was not a civil"
1," years over there like there was like no dance and there were they would just like they were at there was one or two years there were like five or six all the ones going on there and they all died I went to Sundance again to give a presentation with you to back in 2017 so it's been like in over a decade since I've been to to Sundance and I happen to be there at Sundance in 2017 the day Trump was inaugurated"
1," yes I like everyone woke up early that one I've ever owned a bunch of early that morning and did like this protest March down like the Main Street there in in Sundance and the people here are just getting into the hotel for that presentation I forgot the hotel was I stayed at checked in next to lakeith Stanfield I left you probably freaked out in my head I like you enough to it to not acknowledge you walking around there"

1," how to get back I just came out in the bottle I lost you mentioned a pretty did that to the fuk with you"
1," each other it was awful there was another time I don't remember which project it was for this another time that Jason you and I flew out to Portland to do a commercial and like we flew out on a one-way ticket cuz you weren't sure how long is going to take and then we finished like in a day or two was really fast and we're like oh shit"
1," your flight back to Austin tonight if we like haul ass to the airport we can get we can we can buy a ticket so we haul ass back to the air down to the Portland airport you know we go up to the counter to buy the tickets. I bought the ticket at this point and which division of the counter she's like yeah I was only first-class tickets left but that will buy first-class tickets back to Austin so we show up to the airport but we're like we need to get to Austin for 5 seconds to buy those at our boarding passes and before she has them to us she takes out a pen and on the boarding passes your sssss on both of them to us and we're like that's weird and we see that and be like oh you need to step over here and they went through everything we owned it was"
1," went through all of our shit they like real I had multiple people come in"
1," Wanda's in Lake Perris down and just"
1," I'll never forget to add to this day the reason I'll never forget it I remember what the Portland airport carpet looks like hell yeah"
1," actually"
1," or seven years Bernie's name was similar to that of"
1," locator is him they would put you on the list to everybody would look separate from Bernie to be fine but we've all learned it at weekend up but it was not temporary for him for a very long time it was a"
1," one and a half hours so we go up there and you know we first of all it was my first time at like it"
1," and back then it was like $2 to the pound so everything was like super fucking expensive and I found like a Marriott that's like fine we'll just stay at the Marriott that $600 and night for some reason yet and we get there and I realized why it's like"
1," right at the base of the London Eye right across from Parliament and big band it's like if you ever see like an establishing shot in a movie for London like that we stayed at that like right center in that shot that's why this Marriott is $600 a night it looks like an old castle so we show up and you know we checked in and everything and over there like I agree your panel got rescheduled it in four days"
1," shit now we're in London for 4 days with nothing to do I don't remember this we were walking down so we walked out of the hotel we walked by the base of the London Eye photo of you like at the base of the London Eye and like some beer and"
1," would get out the"

1," was your percent right"
1," so we were there I remember we were we were like you know what you were thinking that it will go down there or you'll walk around we'll find a hotel again it's like free iPhone free SmartPhone let me know today I think we went to five different hotels before we finally found one. It's not that big a deal and you're like you do after you know this is my first time in Amsterdam after having grown up in America you like the idea of your kind of with me like a Coca coca coca"
1," going too far on a train and"
1," eating and then we need to start drinking again and 6 hours elapsed instantly I remember getting on that train walking to that train we left the hotel in our train was we were in after them still getting you to walk over to the train station we had like a little bit of weed left and I had it I was like no we can't take it away from me and everything was packed going from Amsterdam to Brussels so we couldn't sit next to each other not a big deal whatever and I had to like sit next to this like middle-aged man and his like 12 year old son"
1," and I was like so"
1," like I said as I was passing out like a twelve-year-old like"

1," part of the convention floor was in the parking garage I want to say that invention was called katsucon to find the right and it was like in February in DC and it was cold but we had that handler was like the other day of the convention had assigned us like this person to help us get stuff like a rudder"
1," and she just kept talking about getting fucked on top of a building while like other people watch right like she wouldn't drop it and would like please don't cut this every time she would bring it up it would get like really eerily quiet and read if you like okay anyway like you want to talk about anything else"
1," we would so many weird or events like that I"
1," where it was only you and me Jason at San Diego Comic-Con yes I do remember that we have to coordinate when we're going to the bathroom we both could not leave at the same time"
1," it was like"
1," it was doing something else I know it's like shit but Jason I got a pump that we can"
1," still at all, comes a lot of sucking work at least the way we used to do that to show up early got to unpack everything got set everything up and he wants done you got at everything down got to ship it all out it's so it's so much more than just like standing there and like talking to people think a lot of physical manual labor, Khan is probably why I love Caleb Gavin and Barbara as much as I do because they were such helps"
1," determine when the last time the three of us performed in some way together I don't know if this is considered a performance but last time we were together and I think it must have been"
1," have been that drunk in order to continue recording we did"
1," until we all got together to do a drunken RV be recording and we recorded Eric for over 2 hours the last thing I remember I remember to Mama to the Nile broadcast"
1," full bottle of Jack Daniels like a full hand and throwing it behind him like that and just hearing it explode that was you"
1," everything out of that insanely fun night"
1," in the in the parking lot and I think we both about in the same time you like I'm leaving Anna we had everybody"
1," in the Bernie was like we can never"
1," put it very much cut down over 2 hours of just"
1," God. Yeah dude"
1," you get like Bernie in that and Jason Jello Gus Jeff I guess together and then drinking starts happening and work tried to happen to the"
1," everybody was like yeah let's have fun Gus's gone I'm liking our stories come back when we have to drive all the way to fucking beautiful"
1," Bernie's house was really in a rural area of Buda so we have to drive out there and you know we're working all these weird hours and I remember one time we'd finished"
1," whatever we were doing and we'd left and we all had separate cars and I got a call from Jeff and Jeff like hey I'm out here in Buda still in the middle of nowhere and I hit a deer I don't know what to do I think it's still alive so just leave it yeah and my I called my ex-wife to cuz I was actually going to see her and I was like I'm going to be late and also I'm not sure what to do I feel terrible I was leaving and I hit a deer just ran across the street and I had that old Chevy C10 pickup truck tank and I hit the deer and I just kept driving so I didn't you know I was kind of shocked but I could hear the dealer like bleeding in the background so I pulled over and I was scared to turn around I called you I called her I think she said go to a neighbor's house and see if somebody's got a gun to put it out of its misery and I'd like to fuck and I think you said just leave it and I thought"
1," it just right and it kill it was not good"
1," head and quickly and then it won't get any more pain that's why I turn my truck around and I like the deers in the middle of the street just like sitting there my back up and I'm like lining it up to try to hit it and"
1," I like the passive voice it had just"
1," to blame Sean but obviously he drop it"
1," 35 bucks for it and you told me"
1," we should start wrapping up at we are at we're getting onto time this is really good though"
1," think I should be there might be Spanish I said it might not only be English"
1," enough"
1," right now that's how to hit"
1," we've ever gotten Kokomo Indiana"
1," with for our merch didn't they come up with the Keep Austin Weird designs"
1," to figure out what the fill it was there we'll figure"
1," are about as long as us maybe longer"
1," enough time talking about Austin with you cuz we got we got,"
1," someday be able to come back again so we can talk more specifically about"
1," where were that easy tiger downtown tomorrow never been to this location there were interesting location Casino course they started downtown on 6th Street yeah I love that place was a terrible location he's hard to get in and out of"
1," I think of the one that's a little more Central at the one over at the old Lincoln Village I guess this used to be a different place in"
1," Lincoln Village shopping center and then they kept it up a few years ago and change it to the"
1," Titanic when it opened"
1," an open space and it would do like a Christmas bazaar they like the armadillo Christmas bazaar"
1," there it's like it's obvious it's very clear this is the theater you just take him to see"
1," but you like 35 runs right down a part of Texas where it divides Texas geography going east to 35 is like you're getting down to the coastal plains and then you start going west and you leave from here if you look West you start to see the hills for me going out to the Hill Country it's weird how different it is and how quickly it makes that change right here"
1," those all the fucking Cedar everywhere"
1," I have a garage so it hasn't been that bad man but man it's funny I feel like I see I see a post in the Austin celebrated every now and then or do you like what's this sticky stuff on my car in the morning I know you haven't lived here very long have you and of course be like always tree sap"
1," note that is not tree sap that is 8 ft 6"
1," noticeable and weird and gross my old place I lived over on the east side just had a driveway and I just have to park under trees and that was a worse because my car would be constantly sticky from from aphids all the time it's nasty it's it's it's it's shocking how sticky that stuff is we were talking the other day"
1," we were reminiscing so we sometimes believe it or not we reminisce without a microphone in front of us is true we were reminiscing about when you went down and visited the town I grew up in down out on the border like years or twenty years ago"
1," different the world is now compared to back then I remember I think what you went back there it was still pretty 911 yes and so you got to experience going to Mexico and United States without needing a passport just walking across the bridge"
1," with you and you were asking about it was eye-opening for me because having grown up there it was like nothing to me yeah yeah that's the river and that's Mexico and yeah you go across it's like no big deal but you were there and you remember you're like so this is the Border like we're crossing into another country like yeah I guess so not a big deal to me having done it for so long I was like oh yeah I guess it is kind of crazy that we're just walking across in another country we went across and we ate at the restaurant or"
1," nachos were invented Moderno years ago it's weird to think that for a while nachos didn't for a long time could not exist as a food in one day some dude was like I'm going to make them and they're named after him like nacho is a slang it's a nickname for Ignacio so it's like because he was not so special and it just became nachos it's like people know it's like there was a dude named Ignacio nickname nacho who made them like one day cuz it's like all the shit he had in the kitchen"
1," get food it was like like they have it seemed to me it always seemed to me like they had renovated it and made it really nice at some point in the mid-70s and then not touched it again it was like kind of holding on to that old that Old Glory that old charm from the mid-seventies and they just kind of really went with it are there too"
1," it's a remember you know Frank moved over moved to Eagle Pass when we were in high school and you know how I lived there for years and I never one of the first times you know we took Frank over it was me and my other friend Ruben and Frank we were probably like 9 1415 walk over to Mexico and his first time there he's like from Street vendors and just eating all kinds of stuff like part way through the day over there I'll be in like a minute"
1," places in case I don't think he used to this stuff you might you might maybe we we we jumped into it with a little too much abandoned"
1," has to say this on this podcast but having grown up on a Border Town and live there for so long or patroller assholes don't give him a fucking and"
1," how do you like it I did not want to pull over for inspection I don't want to go to a secondary I don't want to answer a fucking question about what I mean in the pre passport days to talk to them or explain anything to them cuz I don't owe them a"
1," you remember that we want the same way"
1," always said expectations low so that you exceed them whenever you leave I don't know a lot of people know this if you haven't traveled around the Border this I'm not sure how much common knowledge it is but there's a Zone along the United States border wear when you are departing that zone there checkpoints in the United States you have to cross torrent remember this like when you're leaving the highways away from the border about 30 mi in you have to stop again it is another border patrol checkpoint and they do the same shit you know who are you where you going what are you doing why do I have the same attitude at those checkpoints to they would do the same thing where they would pull you over there be like to pull over we can do a secondary inspection of your vehicle and I never consent to though so if they ever pulled me over for secondary inspection I would always get out of my car lock it and sit on the trunk and then come over to look at your car today I can know"
1," yeah maybe like you know you not consent to search your vehicle no are you hiding anything you know that why don't you could say it cuz I don't want you to get to my car and of course you have to go in a huddle up and to come back and they like what we can bring the dog and you have to wait here until the dog gets here and I might be 2 or 3 hours."
1," you get sick of your daily life being interfered with on that level to the point where look white as an American citizen do I have to explain what I'm doing when I'm not doing anything wrong"
1," your entire life and I was going to say you know that about me when I was younger I had a very much stronger anti-authority Street and do I mean that was a sure way to get me to shut down and then just like dig my heels and I've mellowed out a lot when I was just forget about it"
1," think you know lately you see a lot of border security like really in the news right now"
1," I hope for the Border being insecure or like this is a disaster that I mean people have been Crossing forever I mean this is just the way it's always been. I don't feel like it's always people who don't have first-hand knowledge and who haven't been there who don't have not spent any time in that area for always trying to talk about it like it's a problem and you got a solution for it but if you talk to the people who were there a different feel for it you know they have a symbiotic relationship between the two countries and I just think it's it's so heavily politicized to me especially my family haven't come from Mexico I don't know maybe I'm too close to the situation so my dad was born in Mexico my mom was born in the United States but my mom's side of the family live where they live for so long they live their back when it was Mexico border"
1," border moved across them and that part of the country still largely lives like they're in Mexico it's just like a technicality that now they live in United States like they all speak Spanish they all still keep all the Mexican Traditions just they've been American citizens to 1836"
1," I recommend you check it out it was it was it a dividing line or something like that we talked about like my family's history in a lot about that border stuff and you know what's going on with the border now thinking about that documentary know I feel like"
1," I was a lot more middle-of-the-road and talking in that documentary and I'm a lot more extreme in my viewpoints now that I was like that"
1," much more how much more to get my deals in and the way I feel about it"
1," I think all that sounds really interesting nowadays it's totally different. I don't know if you been back to Mexico if you've driven across or walk across her back since then but now you know you got to show passports lot more strict another country"
1," my mom's coming up this weekend I should ask her if maybe she can bring those"
1," I've gotten some shit from people who say like"
1," the 20,000 you know what they're talking about $20 bill at 20,000 is not a small-town listen it's one free internet that was Tiny and to the next closest town of any size is San Antonio what does a two and a half hour drive away yeah it's like 20,000 people in the middle of nowhere with no internet that was Tiny bits it doesn't sound small but it was really"
1," in there is a Maverick County airport it's not in so they're used to being there for I don't know if you remember any of your pastors at Lake if you always going to hang out it's like we never went around the lake and when I was growing up there there was a small Runway there for like a little single-engine plane could land they close that down and now there's an airport just outside of town and you. Got my pilot license I've been flying for a little while and like you have software that you can use to like look up maps and different airports and whatnot the Eagle Pass airport is the only airport I've ever looked at that says"
1," the runways in poor condition while growing up in the runway and overall it's very dilapidated so yes there is one but it's not like you could book an American Airlines flight there was something not very good but not in very good shape"
1," going"
1," shut up"
1," the other day I flew down I want to see the Gulf Coast Seafood on the Port Lavaca and back are you by"
1," something yeah there's like a m inside that like measures engine time and he was like 2 hours it's about the plane I normally flies 135 an hour"
1," would never fly with me cuz she thinks those single-engine planes are death traps and she soft as your stats a little bit she said she wants to eventually she wants me to get some more practice for I took my father-in-law or a flight yesterday"
1," from the airport to like Lake Travis and then like around downtown and then to the airport"
1," the only reason he wants to be second and I'll give him if I like his reason he wants to be you want me to pass through before Krista Marys"
1," planes it's like you think your you're used to flying from them in a big plane it's a totally different experience like in a small single-engine plane you get bumped around quite a bit depending on the day and when I first started training I was concerned I was going to vomit a few times and I'm always worried taking someone out like I want to put a new head Flex on within Arm's Reach just in case he started feeling bad I'm playing is like taking a hard science"
1," going to be like"
1," there. Probably be twice"
1," commercial let's do it like"
1," Airport"
1," oh man fucking hilarious oh man I did not expect to be looking at stuff"

1," we camped out at the Metropolitan Theater which is just south of here just south of here off right off 35 and I remember we got there tell if we were the only people camping like there was already a line or camping spot"
1," wrapped all the way around we were back and we were there for a while I don't have"
1," and"
1," or any other movies besides, I know we did but I remember what else was playing at that"
1," no new Star Wars since Jedi huge hype for that movie I mean like you said we should have two days early we were still like a hundred and leave the line wrapped around the theater we have very back I don't know like I don't obviously never see a spectacle like that again just because the World Trade even if there was a movie that you choose or you're taking a lot like the website"
1," do that it won't do that I'm an old man now I know what fighter as well"
1," I"
1," like we talked about how I went to Lilliston"
1," in person so I have no memory of buying that ticket"
1," at the longest you've been camping out camping like in the woods for like a week before but when I was younger I would believe it or not I Was A Boy Scout for many years and I grew up like kind of Mineral Area so like I used to go camping and hunting and fishing and all that shit which is a very different life than nowadays"
1," I fired my first gun when I was five"
1," and I was giving my first gun for my ninth birthday I remember getting that gun was old is a 22 rifle that gun battery, Broken Oar House and stole it"
1," hello hello hello and guns for years you know if I had them all the time you're from a young age went out hunting and haven't been very familiar with them for a long time which I think it's something you would be"
1," shocked if you didn't know that about me to get doesn't doesn't fit with with the way you think about me now it is that being said I think we're way to accept it then I think we have some kind of serious the problem with these are we have a I don't know I don't know what's wrong with us I have guns for many many years"
1," why you would lie you be hesitant to handle them after that"
1," that's not bad that's the best possible outcome for that terrible while when I was a teenager I told Gage theme song"
1," mean that's what you want for home defense I guess if you're like if you know how to use it that's what you want"
1," a situation like that house that I'm in or anything like that I can't imagine how"
1," why do you have so many stories like this"
1," yeah it wasn't our house was broken into once I said you know my 22 rifle got stolen but we weren't home like I did and that's the only time I remember anyone stole my coins I'm bitter about it to this day it hardened me and maybe"
1," sucks man. That's really shity"
1," yeah with me yet I didn't feel like I had a ton of coins but you know what your kid like you got fixated on something dumb"
1," a multi-millionaire"
1," knew before she goes to work at the other location and I go to the other. That's why I think it's closer to the"
1," and nice just to go there all the time and then she said that she was a fan of Rooster Teeth and her husband was a big fan so what size are going to give her a hoodie"
1," reminds me of like old Korean folk tales you know my wife is Korean American her parents are from Korea and I've been over there and they especially like this little guy with like his arms out wide"
1," and there's a saying in Korean like if someone's bringing up old shit like like shit from the passing or talk about any"
1," there's a saying that goes like the translation"
1," all I was talking about I would bring I would bring it up bring it up this old chair like such a funny you like saying cool I think when people think there's a lot of people go to East Asian I think it would like Japan is like the place that people go to Korea to a lesser extent I think it's really interesting going there because of its South Korea's proximity to North Korea is within artillery range of North Korea and you can go I mean you can go visit the DMV if you want and I did"
1," but the thing is it South Korean citizens cannot visit the DMZ so it's like if you go visit the DMZ there are no South Koreans are other than the military but you have to submit your passport to the UN and after background check you in advance till I get to do it I could talk about this in the DMZ about that if you wanted to"
1," talk to me or they were top printed it since they emigrated American citizens now so they were like the only South Korean War"
1," but it's it's it's it's really interesting and really scary to go to a to a place that's just like 10. Self is amazingly surprising what a small country it is when you get like on the high-speed rail you girlfriend likes all the futon and just like an hour to install the food is amazing it's a really interesting I think Japan you go to and it's like okay you know this is kind of cool you're lots of signs are in English and you kind of get by it South Korea there's a lot less English and it's a lot more trying to find a way because because of the proximity to North Korea Google Maps is not as precise and doesn't have as much detail because they don't want to put that information out to be publicly available so South Korea has its own map system but it's all in Korean and used to be a South Korean citizen to register to use it so it's like kind of a pain in the ass to get around it's not like joke"
1," Google Maps I can get around exactly where I want to go with us to wait till tomorrow it's kind of in that"
1," drank so you can buy like when you're in the DMZ you can buy North Korean alcohol so we bought the North Korean wine and it smelled"
1," gasoline and it had a bunch of sediment and like leaves in it it was not good when you get on the bus to take you to the DMC like you start like obviously not in the DMZ you get there they put everyone on a bus and like you can take me to the DMV by the ROK army or US Army depending on the day or whatever we were taken by the US Army and let you know everyone gets and you sit down it was between by the possible point in South Korea before you enter The BMC and then like an American Soldier comes in and let's dance at the front of the bus and we were going for it we were trying for a little bit before I realize I called he's not here to protect us here to watch us he's like he's turned facing watching everybody on the bus in a with a gun going out there"
1," motherfuker it's like the ROK sectors were the most secure sector in that conflict like they they do not mess around they are fucking serious cuz it's a it's a mandatory conscription and everyone has to like every male citizen have to serve I think like two years in ROK Army and they are fucking serious about it and I think in the DMZ the people he stationed there it's like the tallest most elite ROK soldiers"
1," I know you didn't actually pick the tallest Soldier to put on the DNC to show the North Koreans like how much bigger people in South Korea are it's like I think you have to be like 6 ft tall to be like stationed at the Home Depot can you look at like you can see the North Korean soldiers were all like really frail and small and you look at the South Korean soldiers like"
1," we we we we should talk about that eventually someday like about all the different"
1," there also amazing, but this is the only way out of every episode new episode before we work or we go up or quart or we order the coffee and go sit down to visit only place where Eric would like you want anything else"
1," anywhere else I didn't want to get something sweet to"
1," no no no"
1," with you a lot lately to clarify it is"
1," and no"
1," tell if the guess is we're getting good for a while and then they got in dogshit which is why I'm done"
1," alright I'll close it doesn't necessarily mean that they're like getting specific words I mean more like the intent or the thought"
1," that some people online have you two are not"
2," and you are right to it yeah fukin right now. How are you doing well I'm happy to hear we we we got coffee from Stinson's this morning which is what like at 45th and Burnett and I were recording at Ramsey Park which is just down the road named after our own call Geoff Ramsey"
2," where do you need"
2," or whatever it is"
2," really not a place to record ever since we came down to gorgeous"
2," just interacting with no secret about that I try to avoid dealing with people whenever possible idle chitchat is pulling teeth to be nice if someone starts talking to you you know you normally feel real engage in these came from like the whole not wanting to talk to people but someone just want to talk about this morning Eric and I got there to order the coffee before you showed up yet and we just could not get away from it as we were parking this dude walked by who look like you've been in a fight look like you lost a fight okay and you like he's walking out of the car and I'm like I hope he keeps walking and he walked into since it's right behind us like great and"
2," he just wanted to just get morning to talk about his messed-up face and I we found out that apparently got hit by a car"
2," so you did lose the fight at the carwash and I assume and I was just like I don't want to talk about it like if you wanted to talk about his his his face and I was doing everything I could to not look at it it's about talk about it I keep looking over your shoulder so afraid he's going to walk in this direction but I don't see him he was really bummed that Taco Shack was closed it was asking about the tacos that sentence like I don't know I've never had the talk with him"
2," that's not me that is not me it's like he was having a rough"
2," it's prettier than that. I would say it's gorgeous but"
2," someone mowed the grass a month ago maybe people doing yoga over"
2," place"
2," this is Rosedale right"
2," we you know we talked about a former coworker of ours several episodes to go George"
2," I learned about the Rosedale part of Austin because of George George own a house up here back in the late nineties that would have been like 19 I don't know what about the house but yeah he had the house either as far as I know in 99 or so and I think what he had done was he bought like the most dilapidated house up here and then slowly himself was like learning how to do home renovations and then fixing the house up so that over the course of years he would eventually fix it and then sell it and flipping himself it was in Rosedale I didn't know any Austin neighborhoods I just moved here I guess and I was trying to you know get the lay of the land where everything was all I knew was that he was at Rosedale was a very expensive place to live in that he was doing a lot of money flipping that house"
2," also is classic George the vi"
2," that's kind of what I did with that I don't know how I remember how much we talked about it at first house I had over on the east side in a little little house yeah it was like I wanted to buy a house in Austin this was what this was 2009 housing Austin and had two while I got you want to spend Austin housing prices at the time so I found you or you found it you told me about it was like the cheapest house listed for sale in Austin at the time and the reason was the cheapest house in Austin was it look like no one had lived in it for 20 years maybe it was like maybe someone had been squatting in at 4 or"
2," feet"
2," what house that was built on three slabs like"
2," built it and then decided to do in a square foot Edition and then do another 50 score for the dishes the dishes are a little bigger than that but yeah it was built on three different slab it was built in the forties and I believe it was originally built for little people because all of the lights while the the ceiling in the house was only seven feet tall all of the light switches work and all of the light switches were about half the height you would expect the door was closed doors were all narrow and really low because of the ceiling"
2," and so when we know my wife and I bought it we had to hire someone wait when I went to figure out what we want this house to look like we hired someone to renovate it and then through hell for 6 months while that happened or eight months and give me higher the same day of the renovated RT contractors it's funny when you hire a contractor cuz like your green to give someone money so you can hate them in six months the money and I'm looking forward to despising you when this is all"
2," I did that once that house actually sold last summer yeah that little house at 7 so last summer and I want to say it's sold for $550,000 I bought it in 2009 for I want to say 160 or 170"
2," proximity so apparently when I bought this house I learned a lot of the first house ever purchased in"
2," I did a lot of advanced home buying things with this house there is a special kind of mortgage you can get call the 203k and the 203k allows you to not only pay for the house but get extra money to do the renovation at the same time it sounds really good right it is a mountain of paperwork like the red tape involved in doing it two or three takes is a fucking nightmare I don't know I lost count of how many times I was screaming on the phone about a 203K mortgage to I also quit doing this is a Bank of America over the 203k me so many times on this mortgage I mean it is a nightmare self renovation budget you can look into the two or three table everyone is right now it is a fucking nightmare you know what I remember the"
2," are all stainless steel and was all one piece there's only there's only two places in the United States I can at the time they're going to place in the US that could do this in like you do you say I'm very sick measurements and they cut like this one giant piece of stainless steel you get like it or you don't bring that you design the countertop exactly how you want and yes this was a huge part of our budget of a renovation budget was the countertop he brought me over just to see the"
2," I thought you were going to do something"
2," great burden"
2," it was a learning process and then like a big idiot you know when that's done we know we finished in 2009 you know you have that whole thing like I learned from this experience I'm never doing this again I'm never going to under this again I did it again into 2018"
2," I'm older I'm a little better off financially I'm not going to buy a dilapidated house renovated I'm going to buy a new house to buy new construction"
2," no one has lived in this house yet so they don't know all the things that are broken like you move into new construction you like it's going to be great wrong we had a toilet that if you flushed it more than twice with start backing up because someone had left like a balloon in the pipe underground like this is like a balloon that they use to clear out after it would like during the construction process and fitted broken off in the pipe and they just left it there so if you flush the toilet twice to water couldn't get past the blue so it would start overflowing that's then you can start your problem you have until it's an emergency and you have to flush twice"
2," suck. So it's funny you mention cast iron pots"
2," that old house the little first house I bought talking about where the main sewer line leaving the house collapsed and broke whatever had to replace it with higher plumber to come out and like I said the dig a trench from the sewer connection to the street all the way up everything up with like this little backhoe and it's like oh your sewer line is cast-iron covered in concrete a plumber is telling me I've never seen that before but cool I just like that it's going to be really difficult for a place like this at the worst thing I've ever seen he's like one time I was working on a house and he's texting me it wouldn't I still think you're bullshiting me there is no way you work it out"
2," years to his life now when the dude was finishing up replacing my main sewer line with the tobacco you know he dug up all that concrete cover cast-iron I don't remember fucking PVC I do remember what it was but new pipes down before he could recover it back up like with all the dirt get to leave it exposed to space the City of Austin to come through the permitting Department had to come through and test it they do like a pressure test of some kind to make sure the works done right"
2," so we had to like leave it open had to leave like this a vertical pipe connected to it so I guess they can hook up and do the test and that was right at the same time that a hurricane hit the Texas Gulf Coast so it rained for a week in Austin and they can't do the test when it's raining because they can't see if water is leaking so I had an open trench in my front yard"
2," week just waiting for the rain to stop so that they could test my pipe and then we could recover the ground and not have a moss lack of a muddy Mosh Pit for a front yard in the fucking joys of homeownership"
2," months when I did my last reservation I I hired like this big Contracting firm to do a lot of like home renovations in Austin and there was like an extra fee you can pay it I can add on where you hire or you pay the contractor company and be like hire this Specialty Company in Austin whose sole job is to expedite permits like they have people who sit in the permit office all day and know all the"
2," parameters that way you can get your permits through the process more easily and it was like an extra thousand bucks or something and it will sit in the apartment office all day for you and make sure your privates get approved and we're not sitting around waiting for permits like I hate I feel like I'm being extorted and I feel like this is a scam but I know if I don't pay it I'm going to be waiting three months for a power disconnect notice but it's it's going to it's going to make my life a fucking hell if I"
2," nice I"
2," renovation will be interesting to see with"
2," interest rates going up like the way they are what happened to the housing market here I feel like giving the 08 09 financial crisis we didn't really see too much of a corrective kind of levelled off for a little bit will be undervalued"
2," so which is why I felt like things have kind of evened out for a little bit like it wasn't a seller's market anymore like you got a little bit of Leverage and I'm curious to see how it was going to happen now moving things are definitely Looney Tunes crazy"
2," I mean that was that was what is this like here we are 11 years later and"
2," this was what this was a particular but I will say this was a pretty bad summer it was not like the worst ever it was like what like 5th worst summer ever or something it was bad worst year ever that was bad so this it should not be this hot right now I think we're at the point in the year where we're entering Falls fall to"
2," going to be nice for a week or two before it gets kind of bad it's like 60 degrees in Michigan right now yeah but how bad is it in January"
2," listen I'm not fucking going to Michigan to do a"
2," probably the better one answered I think we talked about before he bought the house when he was really going to be like in 2010 when I bought my first off I was Thirty-One when I bought my first house"
2," guess there's going to be awesome"
2," long time maybe in two thousand two thousand one select and I was like 2223 I had looked at a house as well but I like I was making good money once I let the call center you know it's working at corporate job and I thought process about how somebody for a long time and I remember looking at a house I really like to Terrytown I want to buy house in Tarrytown I looked at a house of Tarrytown it was a corner lot it was small I want to say to one and a half"
2," 21 and it was $300,000 I don't think that's ridiculous every buying a house for that price you know stupid me multi million-dollar house now but something about you talking about buying a $90,000 house you know which is in it wasn't in Central Austin was off Riverside little further east from there you know it's a prime location that people would pay several hundred thousand dollars for nowadays"
2," two years ago for like"
2," the people are all doom and gloom about the housing market in Austin and I think normally I'd agree with him to problem here that there was a house and walk out of whack and so many people have been moving here and construction just doesn't keep up there's not enough like high density construction projects it's a lots of low-density"
2," chance of staying the amount of people moving here casting the growth"
2," you are we knew someone who"
2," above"
2," the middle in the middle. The whatever whatever he lived but was not a bar and you would like buzz and you could go up like the stairs he lives on the second floor like above it and he had also like a there's like a rooftop you could hang out on overlooking right on 6th Street and let you have people over you like you to hang out and like this is fucking nuts that you live like in the middle of 6th Street and you have to deal with this shit all the time but yeah we were all young like early May 20th at the time visit him a couple times that I could not imagine even even at that age I could not imagine living right"
2," 3:40"
2," ask for more"
2," I worked for a while that corporate job was based out of the Littlefield building there at 6th and Congress so I had an office there in the Littlefield building on the third floor and it was great cuz it like on the weekends I had a parking spot like there was a reserved parking garage that had my initials on it and I can go there Park go out drink have a good time whatever I drank too much let's go to my office"
2," I'm going to sleep on the couch. I just like a badge in go upstairs a little further removed off to the side you know it's it's right on Congress and that's like it's an old building that's actually insulated. He couldn't hear the outside so that was fine"
2," that building has a half floor like in Being John Malkovich lot of people know that if you look at it from the outside you can see where it is like it's where the Littlefield building named wraps around the outside of the building I want to see it's like the six and a half of the fifth and a half floor yeah it's like you go and a half floor so it's like you take the elevator to the 5th or the 6th floor when you get out and then you go into the stairwell and you walk either in or you're out either up or down like half a flight of stairs and then they're just like a little half door in the wall and you can open it up and it's like it's just like Being John Malkovich except"
2," people working in there it's just storage and you just like hunched over in like crawl around a little half floor"
2," across Congress remain on the west side and then like two blocks north is that really tall white building to Norwood building that might be it"
2," imma go now know if you ever heard the story behind the Norwood building building has like it's like a tall white building then on the top it looks like a fancy house okay it's because I swear were built it where the guy's name is James Norwood or whatever the fuck his name was wanting to build his wife Palace in the sky so he built a really tall building and then built them a house on top of it at the time it was like it's kind of the biggest thing around for Miles like so they could live way higher than everyone that's some baller"
2," and I'm going to build a mansion on top of it but we're going to look down on everyone else and nowadays it's like you wouldn't even notice that building it's so fucking lost after years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big Wireless providers if we've learned"
2," so when I first heard that mint mobile offers premium Wireless starting this 15 bucks a month I thought okay what's the catch but after talking to them and using the service I mean it all makes sense there is no catch been mobile secret sauce is the first company to"

2," school has a fucking huge knot in it's mouth"
2," unless you're going bowling"
2," in my snacks in my mind there's always been the same way there's there's always been a boundary to Austin proper and I think that the sprawl will continue but the further you get from that core the more experience became yes overall experience has become different now so I don't know how how how much weight that still holds but I think you'll still see you'll still get to see that sprawl but the further you get the less Austin me it is in general but as Austin changes it kind of like evened out with that spray all is well"
2," I don't know if it's the outside sprawl influencing the Austin itself or if it's just the sheer amount of people moving in and then making noise complaints about in a box if they live by you know that it's a dumb stuff like that and changing in general you know we we used to say was when we were younger that Austin itself was bound on the North by 183 on the west by Mopac and then on the east corner of 183 as well then on the South Bend white so it's like they're kind of the score of the city itself and never wanted to go past the street"
2," we're not too far from North Loop and flight path joked about like visiting our friends who lives on North Oak North which in the grand scheme of things really is not"
2," but I think you know you'll consider potatoes yet sprawling up Cedar Park Liberty Hill Leander like all he"
2," plant fucking dude I fucken Samsung flat so they're building it right off the end of the runway at the airport leaving the tailor airport it's like the airport than a road and then the Samsung plan and it's like you have to be trained right over there go to the frame and I think they're going to be there for like the next year-and-a-half building that place that we're just like"
2," you won't even stop at before either years and years ago I really explode like Liberty Hill this fucking crazy when we first moved here I could have found Liberty Hill on a map I"
2," see I don't know if you remember this at that time in Buda"
2," but there was a there's a lot of construction going on at the time obviously with all the other stuff you're talking about and you know with all the construction they have to bring heavy equipment in and it gets loud roads get fucked up and as part of this when I can start companies was like building this subdivision of houses needed to build a giant rock Crusher I guess like they would dig up huge rocks and I put it in the crusher and it would like breaking down into smaller gravel that they could then like we used to do whatever the hell they needed to do or me was for like making concrete on site or something they would have liked at this rock Crusher and of course it's being an MP's all these people were opposed to than building this rock Crusher out there to build his development so they all put up the signs around computer and I thought it was the weirdest thing I was almost like something out of a superhero movie or something out of like a villain origin story cuz they all have these scientists have stopped the crusher"
2," that's fucking cool like a like a krushers like this super rich like feeling like Lex Luthor destroy the city the citizens are begging for someone to come and stop The Crusher from from destroying their way of life and I would laugh every time we would drive through Buda and see if it stopped the"
2," Austin for 25 minutes each Direction"
2," there was"
2," oh yeah that was a that was brutal I was a lot of driving or younger when I was younger I felt like driving wasn't as much of a waste time as I feel like it is now I think when you're younger you don't value your time as much so you're like oh yeah whatever I'm going to drive it's no big deal that's just part of doing the thing"
2," type radio station yeah yeah"
2," before satellite radio so funny I remember that's one of the early memories I have from when I first moved to Austin like watching local TV and see everything cuz we like to seeing ads for radio stations unlike local TV I know it's one of them I think about that station you talking about that bed-plate start like they would have a TV commercial. It's it's weird watching one dying medium"
2," run ads on another day that's not as dead yet to try to get people to leave this one and then go experience that or to remember it when you get to the fucking"
2," that is something that was already really dead and dying that has just yeah about music streaming killing like album sales are you know how people's listen to have its policing who listen to the fucking radio anymore like AM FM radio like I like you when I was a kid I am really on the way out and gold with long gone turn on the FM radio right now"
2," don't have a cable to plug your phone into ye look something"
2," it's it's it's a different mindset we're right it's like TV is the epitome of gatekeeping content is the internet"
2," has been the exact opposite that like the internet you put something up I don't give a fuk it's like yeah whatever you doing but fuck TV do let me know"
2," fix"
2," you as it is funny how much at all that stuff is changed from you know timer being a little kid and they were like 10 channels or whatever and then it was like the proliferation of cable that you had hundreds and then people became frustrated with it like I don't want all of these channels I just want this car thing and then it took a long time but do you want to know the car thing fuck you hear this"
2," or too short-sighted to"
2," I'm good I look at peacock sometimes I mean maybe I'm not sure"
2," I have it but man are you I really struggle to keep used to finding it to myself I watch a"
2," that it's one of those charges gun going through"
2," almost every season"
2," videos I watch, Plus or the real reason I subscribe the wrong places for air disasters"
2," season of the seasons like they have weird things in the US were some of the seasons are owned by like Smithsonian Network and some of them are like it just all over the place and so it didn't even have every episode on"
2," I was looking at the recording I didn't want you think I'm trying to wrap this up here I just thought the screen was often as I do know it has been"
2," why"
2," lot of work for something you put up for like 2 or 3 weeks and then you then you have to keep it in storage it just seems like we work on top of work just described holidays"
2," like I can't like my mind is stuck on so November 1st down where does it go"
2," I cannot bring myself ever pay for a storage unit with the paper"
2," with you in principle"
2," extra bicycle"
2," to grind a bike"
2," to replace all that stuff for less than two grand"
2," I'd rather something to break even Point"
2," way worse I'm I'm getting further and further off board here"
2," it was no no no it looks messy but that's why I'm like that's why I don't want"
2," three grand to put it in storage it's been two grand a year"
2," I"
2," would have a garage in a not park your car in it cuz you put storage now you can put their cars in the garage has I've noticed that the garage is have become storage and they leave their cars outside that is"
2," no room cuz you're going to the fair she wants $2,000"
2," no I mean I just I guess I would say it's a good guess what"
2," you know how many words are there in the dictionary"
2," in all of them I just I just can't fit everything in my house then you have too much stuff like the problem in"
2," can't wait until everybody else to buy a new"
2," how"
2," so what do you think about the cocking repentant"
2," that's what it's like"
2," a? At the end of it"
2," what do you think it's it's amazing it's a really good like Jeff is talking about the heck you're going to be and I like a little more, this is really really excellent like this is this like coffee from a movie like I feel like Brad Pitt"
2," smell it"
2," yeah did they do pocket composting there s using"
2," the employees have to have accomplished"
2," so talking about the 10 seating for great coffee makes me think about I don't know if if I were with you if we did find this place on her first trip to Melbourne. And if you ever went back in the subsequent trip there was that bar in Fitzroy called naked for Satan"
2," like a rooftop bar out in the area of Melbourne"
2," really liked it's called naked intentionally provocative so you remember hit do"
2," that we ate at horse how can I forget that we were walking down the street and there was any got there the day we got there was a big yellow sign for February on the name of the place it was a big yellow sign for a Mexican restaurant in the Mexican in Melbourne Australia the Mexican restaurant called Taco"
2," they're still open so Taco Bell it probably is a chain they have 25 restaurant she's another drug test driving the one we went to the one on Collins Street I remember that Sophie or Melbourne to the Taco Bell on Collins Street have some chips and catch up for us it's also was"
2," times are probably ten times by now"
2," really cool I think the city's I've been to have been to Melbourne Sydney and Brisbane I think there's only three cities I've been to see what's available for some events for PAX Australia we did our TX Sydney and add another event up in Brisbane before it's a hell of a flight dude I"
2," it's like from LAX to Melbourne you might be on the plane like 16 hours"
2," on this trip with me I booked the wrong flight one time going to Australia so like I forget what the numbers were but it was like there's two different flight numbers at the time on Qantas going from LAX to Ghana cedis to fix one of them was a Qantas Flight 982 dealing with Qantas Flight 93 and I wasn't paying attention I picked the wrong one and the only difference between those flights is the what the wrong one that I picked stops in Auckland New Zealand on the way"
2," get on the plane it's like going to Sydney and I don't realize it till like we're out over the Pacific and I went down there with another co-worker of ours who was a smoker and we we got out of the airport in Auckland and he was like generous I cannot smoke"
2," just got off the plane in Auckland yeah I don't know why so it's like you and you can tweak their there was no passport clearance cuz we're continuing to Sidney so that we went down like this glass Corridor work we could see everyone else to the airport but we weren't allowed out cuz we have been cleared through customs so they like you get routed to like this room and it was like a smoking room they're in our friends I cut off to go I'll go smoking and can't wait to witness it in Auckland for like an hour and a half or two hours and then they loaded everyone back up got new passengers on a week and turn it on to us"
2," think was just him and myself and my wife and we were going to do an event and I know for a fact we went to do an event in Melbourne and it was an event with this happened I think twice over the years it was in a"
2," but I went to in another country who are merchandise never showed up and so it was like me and him sitting in an empty 3 m by 3 m Booth all weekend long with nothing to sell and nothing like I went out to the loading dock at one point I was erroneously told that our shipment was in the country on a truck about to be delivered so I waited out on the loading dock for like 3 hours and it never showed up it turned out it was never even in the country I don't know how I got the information it never made it so that was that was fucking miserable dude I know the time it happened in London that was a whole lot of time to"
2," and the day after you leave and when you come back to the US you land before you"
2," like a person I heard good things about"
2," vibe some of the best Chinese food I ever had was in Australia like in Melbourne Chinatown there there's a place called supper in if you're in Melbourne"
2," and still they're highly recommend that place but I think it's like one of the largest chinatown's in the world is like it was right there in Melbourne yeah I think about like it's out in the Pacific closer to to the Asian Pacific New China I want to talk about our our our first add it to you you said something that made me remember along repressed memory the first time we flew out again. I was back in 2004 and it's amazing how much the world has changed since then because in 2004 when you get on a 16 hour flight from LAX to Melbourne there is inflight entertainment in the form of like little TVs but it's not like on-demand entertainment right they play movies on a loop and if you like the movie you can watch it if you don't like the movie there's nothing else to do"
2," and I remember it was the middle of the"
2," that were in the middle of nowhere where the Pacific Ocean I think I was in the middle seat Jeff at the Isle in Lexing street right next to us in the window I can't sleep so I turned on the TV and a movie starting like perfect timing I'm going to watch this movie it was Envy with Jack Black and Ben Stiller I watched about"
2," I watched about the first 15 or 20 minutes and then turned it off and sat there in the dark in the middle seat on a plane sounds like this is better than watching that movie that movie was awful"
2," like one of those movies that someone makes before they get famous and then it's bad to look at Shell by the studio and someone becomes famous it comes out like"
2," this isn't exactly my thing of cabin in the woods with Chris Evans sure it was kind of held back for a while and then it came out yeah I don't know how that would be got made"
2," mess. What are you doing whatever you're looking at this have a rating for"
2," off the mark you know I wonder what that every time we're"
2," Sink or Swim time on like a lot of that"
2," I wanted to also Circle back to Brisbane is a wild City I think people don't know if I remember right people down there, Tristan Vegas because it's like like there's casinos and it's kind of like the wild west and the entire city will not the most of the city is like dirty 6th and there are a couple things that are illegal in Brisbane one of those things is open toed shoes another one of those things with glass bottles like a fight"
2," and like people will drink get into it so be on your guard"
2," feels like a lot of bars kind of like downtown Austin and their lot of casinos for the casinos aren't huge and illuminated like they are in Vegas right now like a ton of what you want. What was it called there was one Casino in Brisbane that was like in an old Australian government treasury building and I think they called the casino the mint or something like that that's on your mind the casino is a is a retrofitted governor on the outside but then you go into a casino in that regard because he was a kind of understated but they're kind of everywhere I felt like I was walking like I would walk down the street and there be a Dory. I wonder what's in here and you open it it was like oh it's either a bar strip club casino"
2," I like pretty much walking down the street like a copy and"
2," first time we went we met that woman who showed us around and I thought you was going to murder us and remember this because we met her at the event we were doing that you would like me to come on let's go let's go hang out or show you you know all the lady who ran the event or"
2," and so like we left the event and we like you're walking away from the bride part of the city it's getting like darker and darker and like she turns down an alley that is leading us down this dark alley and I'd like to visit and then like she passes a dumpster current pulled on an unmarked door and we go in and there's a bar there it's like a laboratory themed bar but I forgot what it was called the laboratory"
2," I was like there's literally no sign that you have to go in an alley and know where this place is and it's like the super cool bar there's a similar one in Sydney called the Baxters in went to that one but it's a very similar thing where you walk down and Ally the Ally T's into another alley there's a bar there you turn right open the door unlocked or go downstairs at the bottom of the stairs open another unmarked door and there's a huge like bar and it's like the most expensive whiskey selection of ever seen in my life like super rare"
2," really weird stuff like a caged"
2," favorite bar in the world and no signage like you get like a taxi or Uber to drop you off and it's like"
2," the first time I went I got lost cuz I don't know where to go but I can start pulling on doors trying to"
2," fortunate I was still drinking for a while for quite a while after I found Japanese whiskey but it's always really hard to find anyway it's not like if you have any I actually like real a 18 year yamazaki like when I was really drinking and really looking for it like I might find one bottle a"
2," do like I didn't I don't draw a line in the sand at the I never drink however in the past calendar year I probably had four drinks so it's it's pretty"
2," I think I had"
2," I think I'm flying back on a plane in July I had a drink on the plane"
2," was it on a very surface level at the very least it was not letting me get good sleep yeah I realize that like wearing these stupid watch I was like oh when I drink and I go to sleep my heart doesn't my heart rate doesn't go down at all and it stays up the entire time like I'm still awake it's like if I don't drink so it goes down and the rest is a lot more sleep but it is"
2," Tito's it was some other brand I never heard of $100 over to us"
2," and have a drink I"
2," I think if I was in I don't know that I would make a dedicated trip just to go to Perth but if I was in Australia I would make an effort to go to"

2," I don't know I'd like to go back and visit and vacation sometimes it is just super far I mean that's really about it just like giving that commitment and then taking a nap time off to make it worthwhile cuz I know you're making a trip there that make a trip back like spinning out spend enough time for it to to make sense I just don't feel like cutting up that much time for blocking off for a single trip I"
2," of course I'll sit down in the same area and some vacation time is being relatively close to each other as if we went down and didn't have anyone that's like all day needs to take a couple extra days off and go to the other and hang out there to going back and forth between the two was it was always really fun. It's really interesting being that far removed from other countries you know how did that big of a boundary not only in distance but in time you know you look look at your clock in at 5 but it's tomorrow"
2," a week cuz you lose and remember you lose time going and you'll and the day after you leave so it's like you already start at a negative see you really have to have to attend budget enough time in it"

2," obviously I know things are different right now these days to the"
2," when we were it's worth while to me like we live in Austin which is in Central Texas and getting anywhere is a slug like even the United States like if you drive in any direction for 5 hours until Texas yeah you know I'm flying you know you're in the middle of the country but it's like a 3-hour flight for just about everyone is either Coast LA or New York through 4 hours"
2," we were doing a scouting trip for RTX London and we were at the Xcel Center I remember I was standing on a balcony at the Xcel Center looking out and attends"
2," yeah I guess so I decided no medication to September over there and I saw an airport like City Airport from the Excel Center located at in here for like a fly in there or fly out of there is like well it's a small airport so you can fly from the United States cuz you know he throws far as like haha it okay to finish our tour of the Excel Center in that that's what I was there to do for work so the guy pulled out my phone and I was like I could buy a ticket to go to Ireland right now for like 80 bucks yeah okay so like my wife and I was like 5 minutes to the airport right there"
2," London City airport to Dublin cuz I called now now you're in Ireland and you cannot do that here in the middle of Texas in the middle of the United States yeah yeah"
2," it's funny how that proximity effect and I think that affects a lot of people in the United States nothing that's maybe why you don't see a lot of international travel if you know if one takes a long time and to end result it's very expensive obviously we have Mexico and Canada nearby but I feel like that's what that's a whole different"
2," stuff for like two and a half hours and"
2," not even in La when you're almost to LA to Chicago"
2," most flight maybe hour and a half in"
2," is odd that like again the old man in me that like NBC has a night of Chicago programming like in their Prime Time lineup food that's tough"

2," we're just simple"
2," that they did also lost and we work within this building they would know they couldn't they couldn't name the people yeah yeah"

2," oh yeah yeah sure I'll see you laughing for some reason"
2," understand this stuff cause your stuff and yeah"
2," The Carol Burnett Show"
2," ya"
2," it's funny to me because you know also at the time you could try to head your back right like you could try to see if you were there like me to try to program your VCR which fail have very very rarely works but it made me think about like cottage industries which existed at the time which of our lost a time that VCR plus when's the last time you thought about VCR plus which was a system that could be built into VCRs so in the TV Guide they will print like a six-digit code and you would tell your VCR like a six-digit code and it would know like oh since we're I have VCR Plus"
2," I know I need to record this Channel at this time they're kind of took a lot of the intermediary steps out of programming to make sure the TV is on this channel I got to make sure the time's right on the VCR got to make sure it's set to record stupid for the and yeah but it's after the end has no delay in a space left on the tape"

2," that's all that's all. He's a slob wants these"
2," would just someone on social media is is is going I think it's going insane trying to figure this out they sent me a message to send me a tweet I should say the other day saying that he was a hundred percent convinced he had figured"
2," but here we are about figured it out but he wouldn't cut that if you think that we should but he had dumped a bunch of DNS records looking for domains that were registered approximately around the time where I said it registered and then try to grip out information around the letters a n m a and he found a domain that was registered around the time I registered at that was a potential name but it wasn't it"
2," he tweeted to me and then he deleted it I got nervous I think I saw I thought this dude is doing like a crazy amount of work trying to figure it out like really dig into it and it scares me a little bit but I did I did not consider that"

2," whole time we were obsessed with a funny license plates and funny back in the day there was an old license plate that we saw in the early 2000s that someone had registered in the State of Florida and the State of Florida license plates used to have an orange in the middle of them and someone had registered license plate a 55 r g y"
2," so the orange look like an O so it said ass orgy"
2," ever seen a change before the lights go out of it"
2," ratings for sorry I couldn't hear you were tied up with a bunch of stuff"
2," we are we are still drinking coffee though I picked up coffee from Joe's you get out of"
2," taping this at the studio today just cuz of time constraint so I had to find a local coffee shop that was close by that we hadn't done and so I just went to the gym is over there at Hancock Center"
2," but I wish you could have got some. I'll tell you"
2," an effort to go there yeah it's not convenient store does not go to the other job as like if I had meetings downtown like when we're doing our kicks planning stuff it was convenient was right there so that that's why we go to that Austin"
2," it I never liked that location either really I like her. I would never go to that location"
2," Noah has something happened to"
2," hanger. I have no idea why I don't remember the last time I probably went to that was almost twenty years ago"
2," I don't know"
2," like I"
2," why"
2," light will take our next episode of"
2," has the location I'm picking up it's right across from as asks the same thing what are y'all in town for"
2," I had to stop going to one coffee shop because I became too much are regular that flight path when we did episode like to"
2," are really close to the studio nice to stop in all the time I've almost every morning coming into the office and at one point the Lego do is get the double Americano and at one point they change the way they made double Americano so it was less water and soap the Americana was stronger and it came in a small like a shorter cut but I liked it more the old way so I got in the habit of asking if they could make it the old way in the toddler cup and so I've started going there so often that I would walk in the door and they would start making it immediately and it was like one I can never get anything different to I'm now that asshole to ask for something"
2," I can't keep doing this"
2," I'm sure if we drove around I could find a"
2," like that off the top of my head no nothing off the top of my head that I can think of right now do you have more fucking places"
2," I probably sure I do it yet as I'm driving around places that you"
2," we talked about this in the past"
2," I saw so I was thinking the other day in between the last time recorded episode in this one about how you know how much we talked about the pasta place we used to go and talk about going downtown Casino extensively yeah but I realized we left a rather large blind spot in our inaugural trip downtown I think"
2," know what we we kind of briefly mentioned them it's other place we've not even mentioned at all"
2," that eventually became the Alamo Ritz downtown yeah yeah it was a tough"
2," and we're going downtown it was we were always either at casino or the Ritz just like a little further down on the right and had like with a big open space had black foosball tables great jukebox that little balcony play lot of people there a really cool"
2," when they finally close that place down in 04 05 about that"
2," I can't stand it works as a good come from a do you remember"
2," his"
2," I forgot about the"
2," for some reason now I can instantly re picture the Ritz bathroom in my mind I know the exact layout of that that I haven't been in that bathroom probably need to close to 20 years now I know what I like to see if that bathroom like a walking with my eyes closed right now to that bathroom and go take a look it's my duty to"
2," so much time at the fucking rates and what are the reasons I thought I was thinking about the Ritz was there was a pretty popular post on the Austin subreddit shot at the office or"
2," Austin in the late night supposed to buy War for a TV in the late night he said he talks about like his favorite places at the time and what he was doing"
2," Holter it's kind of like this podcast or just people reminiscing about places that were imported a place that that will really cool back then and like what happened to it and it's just like going through it read it someplace we mentioned like one person talk about one Foo the one over there"
2," bunch of other"
2," like bars and restaurants of stuff that I felt like we we frequent did but it was some place is like right right like I forgot about that like someone mentioned that we went to regularly but like the coppertank speed but it's like down the road or someone else mentioned I might have eventually they closed on the remember they"
2," and then we"
2," a long time ago of course like Liberty Lines that you and your men which I think we didn't mention El Sol e Luna remember that was back when it was like on South Congress"
2," we moved over to 6th Street and in that location became the snack bar over there like next to Austin"
2," been going through and reading other people's and we got it was it was it was just a really interesting but they were also some places I don't remember at all okay Bob popular"
2," yeah. The other place is this person mentioned in addition to ball popular we're all like place we wouldn't go to write a popular Paradox the Roxy Spiros element"
2," about Paradox and remind me about like a Phenom"
2," I'm in the late nineties that thankfully died I remember Paradise I really had radio ads all the time because they have phone Authority so I totally forgot about foam parties and how that was a thing for a while in the late night at the club with foam and it's disgusting and filthy and you don't know if you're like taking someone on the ground who's jacking off her fucking or something"
2," the"
2," like 4 a.m. probably since they was 18 and up and they didn't I guess they could stay open past last call if people would just end up going there and"
2," I don't know fighting yeah just just like the worst time to be that or at least I'm sure that's the same now I haven't been downtown in years but it was always the worst time to be down there was right after last call"
2," whether you started someone might just come up and start a"
2," fight stands out as we were doing the screening at the Drafthouse the original location and we've seen the screen season week season one thousand times over while I was playing we ducked"
2," I'm going to go to the"
2," that dude behind me who wanted to fight me for some reason and started screaming at me and like his friends had to come and pull them away just walking down the street going to a bar and like some dude decides you're the target you're going to give your the asshole"
2," how to say wasn't even like a nice place where they might have been like the fox in the Hound or"
2," around that area where the old Waterloo Bridge Marina eventually The Ginger Man yep was I was right next to the Fox and the Hound if I remember right so I would have been right around there I think it's funny that you think that there were places like that was at gatekeeping element way back. Cuz I felt like that was still true to a lesser extent but definitely back there in like nobody really cared what you were wearing or what you look like in most places that you went to the word definitely like some uppity maybe kind of sushi places I've ever seen. Austin so it's it's it's it's strange to think that that was happening all the way back then I feel like you definitely see that a lot more now"
2," I thought that photo was taken at Red Fez"
2," tell me we have to edit the store with this I thought that photo was taken the night that"
2," jog my memory I'm pretty sure that that's the reason I remember that night which was not a place that we typically go to that was over on West 5th still there"
2," Blue"
2," Jeff wouldn't if I was trying to meet someone that would be making fun of me the whole time so terrible for your confidence one and then two cats also married like you know what they going to do"
2," is to make fun of me"
2," but you can go back and I had no confidence to begin with so going negative on the confidence would have would have definitely been a killer that's totally fine that's just the way it"
2," be friends most of the time"
2," yeah"
2," is something but I know"
2," eventually what's in a hookah bar as well as I"
2," just another weird fat in the early 2000s were like hookah bars try to become a thing and then you realize I owe this is like smoking a pack of cigarettes in a setting like this is what this is awful for you hookah bars in the old days"
2," like I think what we used to do typically would we would go anywhere downtown as we find a place to park and then just walk everywhere so we thought we would have regular parking spots we would always hit up and then"
2," which would Mark out of your going on"
2," yeah it's funny I felt like last year or the year before there was a there was an aerial photo of downtown Austin again puts in the Austin subreddit and it was amazing how many parking lots there were yeah it was there weren't very many buildings are still a lot of empty land in downtown Austin so even if like we will be always look for the free place to park if you want to pay to park there were definitely plenty of your fucking"
2," or if I'm just continues to this day there also I'll play me three places where a dude will stand there and pretend he's working and take him to be able to park in the lot a lot of that scam and then of course the people who say they might my other favorite is if you would say that he gave him five bucks to wash your car for you okay cool you going to fucking my car like a threat"
2," I guess eventually everyone must have like a tank for that stuff and as the years go on it fills up and fills up and finally reach one day we like that's it I'm not doing this anymore"
2," Street"
2," they're trying to trying to revitalize that Waller Creek area right there speaking of that little area"
2," wallaby. Since we moved here pretty aren't they genuinely putting money into it like they're trying to make like a a Riverwalk"
2," Sabine four Sabine crosses 6th Street Rock where the Easy Tiger used to be like"
2," just been chilling and down there by the Four Seasons"
2," I thought they just got tied up"
2," cool you do yeah"
2," held the Pecan Street Festival for the first time between a Coke for the first time since covid like 2 or 3 weeks ago"
2," kind of remember that guy who used to like sit on the sidewalk and like you spray painting painting"

2," nothing is going to seem like a tangent but you talking about like encountering strange people or Flex really unsafe everything about a story a time that you and I went to Baltimore"
2," doing nothing or what are you doing oh my God we're in Baltimore for Otakon and and we we were done for the day I don't member for the entire event or what but you know we wanted to be done for the day we want to get a drink so we're staying at a hotel pretty close to the convention center so go back to the hotel drop off our stuff and we're like we're going to go get a drink and they were walking out of Hotel first. There was like a Maybach Park Drive"
2," funny so we look to our left and there's like a bar right there and go there and get a drink over there to the left and walk up to the door this bar and it's like it's almost it was really dimmed in there I remember that it was a it was a look like it looked like a stereotypical bar out of the wire very narrow and long with a long bar with a bartender behind it and it's kind of a dim and as we walk in and sit at the bar get a couple beers and we're sitting there drinking our beers remember we're really close to Convention Center this dude walks in in a costume like obviously an attendee from oticon described his costume"
2," in and it's like like almost everyone stop what they're doing everyone in the bar stops cold and turned and looked at the door at this kid who who walked in and it's silent is like absolute I'm the kid must have realized that something has changed cuz he stops in the doorway and someone at the bar just read without dudes motherfuker what are you doing"
2," it's a really funny moment in my mind to me but a man that kid must have been terrified he died"
2," I wish we had more time to explore Baltimore Baltimore once or twice but it was always I just remember being told"
2," large"
2," like a stuff even besides facts are other events like up in Washington State"
2," looking to really grow the audience was like trying to find any anime convention out there was a trifle with had like 30,000 attendees are high or something like that"
2," year our program do on holidays Labor Day was always the worst because it was packs Fan Expo and DragonCon all that weekend and we're not enough of us to do all three of them we would split we will do our best though"
2," went to DragonCon a few times"
2," the thing that I was talking sticks out of my mind about DragonCon is lots of"
2," varsity win talk about we went at Mulligan's one time when I went there with my dog and"
2," we went there with some how can I put that we went there with some people who we saw at lots of"
2," there was there was the couple of guys that weren't necessarily like they weren't content creators they they they stole software but they were at lots of these conventions and we were always relatively close to them like when I take let me look like a boots were always so you know if we see if we saw these guys at an event let's go get a drink or go get something to eat or whatever and we hung out with you guys all over the United States at all these different events and they always had the worst stories and the worst things that happened to them"
2," one of them was kind of up"
2," kind of a fuck up"
2," would you like a damn well I lost all our software lost all our money stories like that"
2," over one time we were at San Diego Comic-Con that you were staying at that hotel right next week of its headquarters at the Marriott or yeah we're at the Marriott and we're down in the hotel bar having drinks and drink and have drinks with these guys and the two of them were like we're going to hang out with you girls we met earlier alright cool have fun you know less risky folks having drinks are in the bar or whatever finish the night went to bed I remember waking up the next morning coming downstairs to the lobby the Marriott cuz I'm going out to go to the convention center"
2," working and one of those dudes comes up in a cab gets out of the cab it's to still wear the same clothes from last night it doesn't look like he slept his hair is like his hair is all fucked up and have a good night and just give me like a thumbs up"
2," walking to the hotel"
2," easier to do any like 25"
2," funny because you know when I think our goal was always to try to make the experience as seamless and fun for anyone want to come over"
2," experience and there is so much unglamorous work that goes into that you know whether it's like oh I've got to print this Banner of shit the banner doesn't have grommets I need you right like I have to fight with a union they want $700 to move this palette 15ft you know it's just all these little things that wear you down that you can't let show when the door slightly open"
2," if you learned a lot a lot a lot that I think if you haven't worked a convention you don't think about it because I remember we went to so many events"
2," we knew everything in and out about an event and then we were like so we can run around a vent we are in our TX ahead is like there's like a whole other level reading for our checks 2012 the first time out of the convention center and it was something dumb it's like in this part of the hallway and set up a table with some boxes in TVs come from OK Google solve that you want to start on the table okay what color is a skirt okay I didn't need to be connected to the internet"
2," how we're getting power there ain't no drill a hole in the table okay where's the drill coming from Warsaw whole going to go you know my grilling right every single step every single little thing used to be like a punch list behind it and get it done omigod this is a fucking nightmare just like every single planning every single thing I kept everything had to be like there were so many steps to even getting like a floor sign whose printing it was brought in the graphics where's it going to go who's going to put it there was going to take it down we don't want you to be on at home I got"

1," there was you you said patients and maybe think about something I haven't thought about in a long time when it when we worked at the call center you know we deal with a lot of old people and there was a common phrase they all said"
1," listen to patients they would really know they be like I would be so grateful you're helping them figure out how to dial the internet connection up and be like oh you got the patience of Jobe"
1," you know"
1," but that's where I came from some they're so where we are today you know where it were like least like I said it kind of close to Q2 Stadium or also close to the domain which did not exist in the late nineties and we're right by the pickle Research Center for UTV do like super computer stuff they're up here the domain this is to all correct me if I'm wrong Jeff I believe this all used to be the IBM campus"
1," IBM still up here but they've retreated it's a much smaller footprint all of this used to be and I think that's why they call it the domain cuz they started it like during the like really building it out during the.com craze and they wanted to capitalize capitalize like on internet terminology and it was called The Domain has resulted I feel like it's gotten away from that cuz oh yeah it was IBM now it's you know we're using me hip internet terminology"

1," and try to make it like a a big deal and we do they were going to make this three-wheel car and you're going to revolutionize the Auto industry and it just never came to fruition and accusations of it being a scam and it if it said I want to say too much about exactly really interesting document I don't remember the name of it for the life of me right now but I'm sure if you look up three-wheel car it's a documentary and they'll go to the whole story and the story and eventually the people who ran this car company kind of went into hiding out near Bastrop and they were the ones who set up this group of homeless people who are going around selling roses all around Austin it's a it's a"
1," you know some of the some of the people I'd want to say too much kind of maybe taking advantage of people but yeah"
1," really interesting I'd like it we saw those people are specifically that guy who used to be there at Riverside 35 from Bastrop"

1," burrito that really sucked"
1," Buda you're looking at up 30 minute drive"
1," he"
1," I remember that there was a it was interesting working in such small quarters likely was a one-bedroom apartment and it were a one two three four six of us in there it was you Nathan Jason Vernie Matt back then"
1," no. I didn't like that"
1," really yeah she grew up like in the next small town over and do some presents together like I met back up and I was like 10 different like when we were ten"
1," great thing about Jason"
1," Do you remember one of the worst arguments that all of us ever had its related to that office the target trip o"
1," one hundred percent 100%"
1," Matt Matt did something no one could agree on what stupid desk if I think we all had to have the same deck for some reason we wanted everyone wanted a different desk and for some reason no one would agree to get different that's we all have to get the same one eventually but everyone's pissed off at each other cuz we end up with desks that nobody likes go to pay for it and then remember he got his credit card"
1," American Express credit card issuer as a result"
1," remember that also happened to view the apartment you know we would still very young and still growing and we had some cash to deposit and we at the time we get a p.o. box in"
1," store something at cetera I think we're a very brief time it wasn't"
1," it's"
1," okay let's go down well go together whatever was like four of us we're going to go deposit this cash at the bank Bank of America check the PO Box will grab lunch or down there there's a long line at the bank so $15,000 don't worry I think"
1," go back to the office and then the confirmation for the deposit comes through and the confirmation for the deposit is like"
1," confirmation $2,000 less than we were expecting it"
1," stole the money cuz I money had been in the office for a couple days before we have a chance to go deposit it and we all have to like sit down in that living room"
1," we're all going to leave for the day whenever we leave if but if we come back in tomorrow morning at the $2,000 that you sitting on the table there will be no further questions no repercussion no repercussions were not going to care if we just want to get that money back we know how much money you were supposed to have and the bank told us it was $2,000 a month out who took it"
1," the end of the good and the Bad and the Ugly"
1," home and is the money going to be there what's going to"
1," will show up the next morning open the door no no money there"
1," intense someone took it they didn't return it they're like doubling down on this like that window has closed and then like that that first that morning was like no one said a word to each other once I sat down and like get to work they needed to do whenever we just like really pissed off at each other and around noon or 1 p.m. we get a call from the bank we was kind of your deposit"
1," I had like 24 or not quite right for almost 24 hours or just like intense finger-pointing difficult it was a bank error because we're at the ATM and get the money"
1," we were falling apart yeah I like really quickly"
1," cash from event for psych we had just started having it like everyone had always had it's not like we had money laying around everywhere but when you were was Catherine when you"
1," the company and they had Integrity. I think we never put ourselves in a position where that was even possible like no one was ever not like we can trust each other but no one is ever alone with it was always like a couple people working in a couple of people doing the counting together a couple people like moving to register safety you know"
1," and"
1," why you asking asking me anything about"
1," ironically it's time for Craig m"
1," but no"
1," movie Teeth on Timmy T remember this now it's awful it's"
1," said it was definitely water down coffee"
1," a field trip here one year when I was in in math Camp to the pickle Research Center"
1," out there like Arthur like rumors that they have a nuclear reactor in the basement I thought the common property"
1," it before I came here this morning"
1," stay on what I don't know I said I was before ready"
1," stay on what I don't know I said I was before ready"
2," turnstile it was almost too cold these"
2," so we we we we did we try to do our Austin Java Redemption today but apparently every Austin Java in Austin is closed except for one there's only one left and it's clear on the other side of town for my studio never knew it existed but pronounce Manchaca to a park I probably going to buy million times and never actually been to"
2," the coffee that was missing from the turnstile coffee and it up if he ended up in here some I don't know how to call bruises but that is a strong Americano"
2," 4th while I'm in there a long time ago I had no"
2," and"
2," the opposite of purple on the color wheel that's a now I know why they closed them all yellow snot as inviting as purple is a royal"
2," Austin Java do you think there were at its peak how many locations cuz I like that I can think of the one"
2," I could if I had to guess I would say like 5 I would say 5:00"
2," the one"
2," city hall on 2nd"
2," yellow one version down on Manchaca"
2," 1 North or North of my head right now. Doesn't matter if it's"
2," special do you live here man RTX that's all that's a whole thing I can't believe I told you guys would walk around to Austin Java in the summer cuz that's events like in July and it's hot as hell."
2," in"
2," was not used to that before I moved here very weird the only reason so that's like hot that"
2," I wish we could have that event on a different at a different time of the year to cuz it's so oppressively hot the first year we had that event was in 2011 it was at a field not too far from here actually out here in 2012 was the first year that we had it at the convention center field office"
2," little office complex thing at the convention center November after we did used to run the event back then after we finish the 2011 if I was like all right cool that's going well for let's let's let's have the convention center schedule a meeting with the convention center people like to try to book dates and they looked at me like I was stupid cuz I was and I was like I was like May 2011 it was like yeah I want to book a the command center for an event 2012 yeah I learned a lot of dates we have available 2012 is Fourth of July weekend and you can have you know exhibit hall one will take it and the only reason those dates were available is cuz no one was stupid enough to have an event in Austin In the Heat of the summer on Fourth of July weekend and we've kind of sweet kind of stuck with it you know I was like okay that's kind of hard 18 and sometimes we have to move it a little bit cuz of calendar issues or other"
2," events are going on but it isn't March a C L & F what are in October and it's because those are huge event and that's like the best weather in the most ideal time to visit Austin work the idiots have in our van out there in in July In the Heat of the summer"
2," people are constantly warned about the heat in about how hot it get to how long the Heat last and I still regardless of how you still hear about people moving here"
2," I meant after less than a year leaving his biggest big cat deal with it it's no one to live here I don't get it"
2," it's it's weird that we're time of year where I was driving around probably noonish yesterday and I saw it like these two women crossing the street wearing sweaters that they obviously have put on when they left wherever they lay on the morning and they just looked miserable that gets way too hot to go to the sweater right now cuz I think it's not unbearable but it's it doesn't rain this morning so it's at muggy awful kind of day I hate it I don't know if you want if you want to talk about our checks much"
2," had mentioned the dates and it got me thinking about a lot about"
2," most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me at first but I got I don't know I don't embarrass easily so that's a tough one I think you're maybe kind of the same I had to leave the stage what I was on a panel with kind of funny and Greg Miller hit me over the head with a prop fake bottle that shattered and it cut up my forehead and I was like I pretended like you know the big bottle knocked me out and was laying on the ground if I can feel liquid all over my forehead like I think the bottle cut got to like jump up and run off stage and get like first aid real quick behind the stage and come back out a little woozy after that"
2," underdog team to see blood on myself so I can take care of this real fast"
2," you know me I think it's always trying to put the best face on and trying to be like perform through it and get through it but man those were there were some rough years or some really rough years what are you"
2," 5 years ago maybe going in"
2," has been through"
2," several iterations about what the event is and where I think we always struggle are still trying to identify what is the event and I think the best way to execute on it and I think you know what we're continuing to try to try to figure that out and I think that's that's part of the fun of it is"
2," trying to try to figure it out and not being afraid to do something different and I'd really like to see"
2," us fully lean into that and do something off the wall nuts are used to back when I used to always pitch these crazy ideas that I had no background and you know we we hired on people who did and we worked with companies who that's all they do is do events and I would pitch ideas that would just have every impression in the room I put their head in their hands and be like why or no visit some of those people think they're a bad idea doesn't automatically make them a bad idea because"
2," one of my ideas was to have no signs anywhere"
2," encourage people to explore and find things without actually telling them exactly where to go at Huron and that you could have like cool pop-up events hidden around and that nothing ever is there is no just no signage"
2," I don't know if you see that there's a there's a poster somewhere around the studio it's like a drawing of me wearing like those x-ray glasses I got McSorley's on them because RTX chaos is fun be made that that suggests an event planning company make that it responds to that suggestion and I was like unofficial are it was like if we leaned into the chaos aspect I"
2," all the way everyone's just agree with me I feel like I'm getting bullied here nobody wants to hear the truth that is really a great idea that should be the name of your autobiography"
2," yes but you want to use them I want to use them. I don't want to say all of them that that's the one about when I'll admit will probably never get used but I do have a lot of other ideas that I would like to see Revisited"
2," to that one"
2," I had an idea idea for something I called secret r-tx which is you hold the event and you don't tell anyone where it is it's like you have the floor with exhibitors and stuff but then every panel and every event is a secret and people have to find it and it's distributed all around downtown Austin whatever random venue at random times and it's all word-of-mouth there's no again this like an extension of the no signage"
2," and then we're going to be home like"
2," for you from the get-go I would have already"
2," of"
2," but didn't you say you're going to Denver if you'll have to figure out where and when"
2," Gus"
2," I I think I was influenced by those early a r t z and b like that old game was it a late 90s early 2000"
2," 1100 remember that you signed up for it and there was no light gameplay there was but there was no game client in the traditional sense that you're thinking of yeah it was all like you submitted your phone number your email address and your instant messenger handles and it was all like they would contact has like a like a spy story that was told via the media forms like you would get messages or phone calls later and figure it out. Figure it out and it's like trying to tell a story without having without like launching a game and looking around kind of blurring the line between reality and fiction"
2," maybe like it was before I look be so that's not right it's like if qanon was real and there was a way to participate I would kind of like to do you think"
2," could be paying customers 499 a month I think"
2," when you mentioned lost I bought that Blu-ray box at when it came out and even the box it itself was like a game that was like things hidden in the box set and like secret messages in fact like one of the bonus disc with hidden in the packaging got to like figure out how to open it and realize I go there's something else here and like open it up and get an extra disc out of it I thought that was like a really well put together box set"
2," him go back to DVD testing so you don't realize this cuz I'm saying this you to any one listening unless you offer to DVD you don't realize when I get this fucking ancient now nobody cares anymore but you don't realize how every"
2," and you have to when you're designing like the menus and the layout of that like every player will interpret everything a little differently so we would have to make a DVD then try to test it on as many different DVD players as possible you offer it didn't David have Lee there's some obscure DVD player wear o h s auto place with all the special features one after another and there's no chance for the whoever's watching it too or give any input"
2," up and then Donuts has a thing"
2," we made sure to hit the game consoles game consoles playing in there so that was like the focus of the bulk of our testing and then whatever other DVD players we had or we could buy to try to to test him the Easter egg I remember that gave us the most trouble"
2," was it season 3 where if you left it on the title screen and didn't make a selection after while like Doc would show up and steal one of your menu options yeah but there was one brand of DVD player wear as soon as you put the disk in Doc would immediately begin stealing all your menu options if it's like you couldn't actually watch anything on the disk because it was just like start automatically going through every one of those like some others know what to choose from"
2," I think that ended up having to get a real turd that just went out so that we had certain people I think yeah"
2," can you finish while I was going to"
2," the time bar try to see you know like all this extra something at the end of the sir you do you skip ahead pasta credits to find something it's difficult to try to hide something so to get around I remember when we were leaked episode 101 to try to get around that I wanted to put out different versions of the episode but couldn't figure out a way to do it without"
2," pulling it so when we put your this back before future by that you would click on a link on our website to download the video I think we made every letter in the link a different link so when you looked at it it was a but it look like one link to download the video but really every letter and every space was a different links to depend on where you click on the link you got a different version of the video downloaded we couldn't you couldn't help until you like that wouldn't wait till it comes to talk about it's like oh yeah it was weird at the end when this happened I thought you're talking about the end of the video was this that should try to create that just came out with me. What a pot of paint"
2," there's a long long day of the week"
2," it was real and then I don't remember this like I got home I live off lived off of Lake Austin Boulevard past the fuck out and then the service at all died because most people figured out you could download multiple files we would go back and start downloading so it's like everything crashed but my phone was dead so I work for like 4 days so you could call me you had to come over and bang on my window to wake me up in the middle of the night to remember that and I was like what the servers are down you got to go fix I'm had to drive over for a colocation facility off of Montopolis and reboot everything and get everything working again it's like I had my lotion at the Dead"
2," so you have you got to sleep a little bit speed you have to drive across town to go wake me up after you went back home to sleep but I have to go back over to the servers to get them back up and running so I broke it download stuff again talked about fucking pain in the ass"
2," know that was"
2," the that was the peak of that kind of stuff was right around that time"
2," we definitely kicked up in the bar after that cuz I think about like some of the ship that happened after that at the Congress office for sure"
2," for sure making the NCAA like Jumbotron videos the mountain videos of reconstruction stuff and if any one of those projects was too much for"
2," yeah that was that was at the Congress office and that was in itself"
2," different shaking his head at"
2," should go back and have we should do an episode of Anna from like The Hideout which was right next to where the office used to be that building was demolished it's a hotel but I have so many memories of that block at specifically that alley behind the vet office because we would walk in a toasted or that led to the alley and that's how we would walk in and out. There's a door to the front to but a lot of times people walk in and out of the alley in that alley is filthy I have I lost track of how many times I stepped over human ship just to get into the door to go up to work there was a there was a a restaurant under us and during the lunch rush you could smell really bad to it but it's turned on and I like all of us"
2," start coming upstairs to where we work with a Pita Pit and"
2," it was easy it was like we had a door that went downstairs directly into the restaurant just like without going outside walk down going to the restaurant and and get food and there were so many signs in that stairwell that said do not go upstairs private property there were signs on the door that said not a party to see if it's not the Pita Pit do not knock on this door do not try to open the store but it was like a Non-Stop you with your people juggling that door handle or knocking on the door trying to get in what you doing did you not see the 15th fucking signs and by people with Peter in their hand at a soda like I can't help you if you can't come up here go find somewhere else to eat"
2," about that location was that"
2," it's close to downtown do some of the Congress and doing sxsw like every possible place you could have a band has a band and their the Pita Pit downstairs would have shows during sxsw and I remember once we were all trying to work and there was a band performing downstairs under its first of all it was like it was sounded like a pirate was singing We went down there and it was like a band where they did like pirate sea shanties and its before like sea shanty became popular couple years ago this was back in"
2," the next band comes on and it's a band called four on the floor"
2," all drummers all drums and"
2," band the drums were so intense that you could see on her computer so that the hard drive for being jostled around so much that they couldn't read and write at the normal rate cuz they like the heads were skipping that we have to shut down like we literally cannot do any work as long as four on the floor for me. Sticks with the stops we went we went like walk around the block for a bit until they were done playing anywhere right now we can get back to work it was like everything the decks on the floor were"
2," we couldn't you can sit with a cartoon kind of sleep and everything shaking"
2," hardly ever have a chance to walk away turbo"
2," I don't remember the name of the pirate sea shanty bandeau on the floor"
2," two days a week"
2," Buck's so here we go"
2," trick isn't what we like this like the soft or hard kind of Rocky Gravely ice the garbage"
2," I can't think of the last time I've been here in this part of town"
2," anything about it there's a lot of talk about like South Austin versus North Austin with the river like dividing it and I feel like this is very much like quintessential what you imagined South Austin of stuff it's weird what a natural barrier that creates in the city like a lot of our traffic woes are because of the river that flowed sorry the lake that goes through the middle of a city"
2," I'm at Forest like funnel people to like certain show point that makes everything all fucked up trying to get on the stupid City"
2," so it was the best friends think you were like a trouncing through the woods with my cut out"
2," ooo unrelated I just remembered something okay do you wear"
2," I don't know what it's called you know what's going"
2," last week my car reeks of club today and it was like I got my car looks like I didn't smell it when you were in the car but something about it like sitting in the sun and baking there the day while I was at the office like what the hell is that I turned and looked at the passenger seat and it was like you were still sitting there with him he must have smelled great. That's all I have to use like unscented deodorant and I can't wear cologne like all my bath products have to be unsafe to use fragrance-free detergent fragrance-free like fabric sheet dryers"
2," do I would have been dead I was thinking of going out of a lot of my allergies but when I was younger I was severely allergic to grass and just about every tree you can imagine life was hell I've grown out of a lot of them but I guess he's"
2," it's not a severe anymore but it still bothers me I hate spring time when everyone starts cutting their grass"
2," go to the winters like nobody's cutting it it's fine it's not in the area where you can't get rid of"
2," think you're stuck in the"
2," table"
2," it was like"
2," Bobby like a little mask On the Border in degrees outside and I"
2," man"
2," river going to find traffic at Southpark Meadows"
2," okay I'm asleep"
2," the house looks at all or is it all been purchased"
2," homes left that are occupied occupied"
2," poly concrete slabs that are overgrown with vegetation it just looks like it's just that it just looks like"
2," did you receive Barbarian like you were just driving it was like that's kind of"
2," started to close a lot of it up to the public"
2," what were you gay keeping"
2," can't drink a coffee too strong"
2," it would be the correct solution it's so strong"
2," we like a bean and"
2," I was very confused after the first bike I was at I mean pick a lane that"
2," six location for me it's so far from the studio for women at South of the river I don't think I would ever"
2," what's your what's your favorite soccer then right now"
2," there's one right by the studio to over there Mueller on the weekend and you haven't yet because I've gone there before so I'm right and waited like an hour to get food. They are you in the morning"
2," not eating till like 7 p.m. tonight but I do go Veracruz I think they're up there pretty solid there's a breakfast tacos but there's a great Mexican place that sounds like a Mickey I'm not putting a big-ass risk on it but I'm not a vegan Mexican place it's called Missy they have a brick-and-mortar off at like Burnet and 183 excellent tacos"
2," like like I said all that shit is it's really good tacos and beans and rice I think that place is like an excellent but it's vegan"
2," you can get a 2004 Tahoe do you"
2," that's very odd I thought that was a pretty good one"
2," well."
2," that's a good one you listen you listen to us take a"
2," either"
2," The Hideout on Congress which is next door to our one of our old offices which is no longer there at the hotel now I think this is the first time I've been back to The Hideout since we left not because I dislike The Hideout or any of The Hideout I don't come down here really to this part of downtown anymore in the morning for you typically drink coffee"
2," for RoosterTeeth yeah I worked in a router with your kind of just down the street on this block and I would come here all the time even back then I worked at that office from like"
2," 2000 to 2002 I think I spent time you know we had a building over here kind of close to 6% of the building over there kind of close to 7th and Brazos and some of the old like"
2," there's some like old rtaa is about my time working over there and it's coming back here and seem like some of the stuff that had to change I remember once back in like I don't know when it was 99 or no no no no it was 2000 or 2001 we opened up the second building like this kind of like a cross the block from the first building we worked at and we have to connect the network so that I work with and I connect the networks of the two buildings and it was a huge pain in the pain in the ass cuz we weren't sure how I'm going to do it and someone at the bright idea of buying sickness"
2," this laser that you could aim and connect the two networks that way so we put a laser on the roof of one of the buildings and we had to put like the other corresponding laser on the side of the other building but it was like I was like 22 or 23 had no idea how to do it so"
2," we just rented a cherry picker and like a bunch of cones and some hi-vis vest and like at 3 in the morning one night me and my car just showed up here and let ConEd off a section of the street and I started directing traffic and it was like got in the cherry picker and installed this laser on the side of a building and we were driving around I pointed out that laser still there on the side of the building 20 years it's still just hanging out there on the side of the building so it's all that right do you know"
2," nobody knows what that thing is and it's"
2," rifle scope so you can make sure the two lasers were perfectly aligned and aimed so that the data connection was optimal and at one point one time like one of them got bumped or Jocelyn and they were out of synch so like the network connection got really slow and we couldn't figure out like we couldn't get them realize I had to buy like this off the shelf consumer wi-fi system and get the super directional antennas and try to aim them out the window is across the block at each other like really slow and reliable Wireless technology 20 years ago you know it was like it worked as a stopgap fix until we got the lasers realign but man it was weird while"
2," I thought I remember when I interviewed for that job this was like when we were still work at the call center I got a interview for this job I came down here and at the park at the Littlefield garage which is a prank"
2," Congress and I was"
2," all dressed up fancy you know if your 2019 were like a long-sleeve button-up shirt and a tie and shit and I parked my car in the Littlefield garage you know it's got in the elevator hit the button to go to the ground floor got to the ground floor and when the doors opened there was a dude standing there who worked at the call center hey what's going on today to try to walk away as quickly as"
2," she was dressed like normal shirt I went to the do a job interview interviewed with the like the guy who would end up being my boss argued with him for an hour about technology but the stupid i t nerd ship then he introduced me to like the CTO of the company argued with him for another half hour left cuz I well that sucks I'm never getting that job they hired me anyway it was an hour and a half"
2," their infrastructure was stupid if I was never going to work on and they hired"
2," guess what"
2," 16"
2," that's yes"
2," or two"
2," we would also like the blizzard cinematics"
2," Starcraft intro the Diablo 2 intro the cutscene"
2," because we were we moved into that building immediately late everyone off I was the only person working in that building for like a year"
2," Year's a lot and they never laid me off or fired I have to quit if it's funny because the main door like I said you know there was cameras all up and down the street then I pointed out that side or do you guys have before we came here that went straight to my desk but no one knew about that door and no one had the batch to be able to swipe into that door cuz I got to make a quick entrance at a Quick Escape buy new to losing that door was the main door where everyone else came in and out of or had access to was amazed that was that was observed all the time"
2," I remember once you know they were doing a lot of layoffs for a while and at once"
2," I'm hesitant to tell this story but at one point we took all Fridays fire days cuz they would round people up in and fired a round it up to come through and get let go then we're going to go have a beer at Mike's public will talk about here in a bit and one fire day my boss came by walk by my desk and was like hey I just got called in the conference room and he had to be like a stack of disks and was like don't let them have these"
2," okay and I just like to stack of disks and put them in my desk if you went into the conference room he was fired and then like"
2," the next Monday so I'd like to go we can pass them in that Monday his boss which was now my boss came by my desk cuz I have you seen these disks I'm looking for your boss should have had their mother is it on the desk I don't know what they were"
2," is it something you say yeah it was it was some installation disks for some it's like no one else would have needed that right it was like it was like my department installation disks for like our Enterprise software that I kind of ran everything in the in the company likes if anybody needed them it would have been meet like I was the one who was in charge of that I can keep my boss just wanted to be a pain in the ass to his boss and like make him worry about knowledge that was lost I had if I knew where that works if anything ever came up I could easily use them and fix whatever needs to be fixed but I kept those in my my desk for the whole time until I get ready to quit nice"
2," no they're not in that building anymore I have to build a new Fortress and they relocated their headquarters are in an original by their headquarters was here"
2," I work because I worked idea in his meeting we had rules as far as passwords and you know security and what not his password was CEO and we could never get him to change it and he had it on a Post-It note on his monitor in case you forgot it was in case you forgot it's so his secretary could log into his computer and read him his email if you was out of the office and it was it was just one thing after another and when we tried so hard to get him to change that to do anything to know no password CEO like we we know we know we know who dude"
2," they eventually I don't know if I was young at the time I don't know how it went down but he was ousted from the company"
2," ended up this is towards the end of my time there so I don't know a lot about it but they ended up moving the headquarters out of Austin to I want to see if I can get an Apple has someplace to go to San Antonio San Antonio was one of our sites but they moved the headquarters backup ending up cuz I'm used to yell was from Indianapolis and at one point they had like a big meeting up there fluid people out fire them and then canceled it return"
2," it was it was bad it was real bad going back a few steps would get fired would go there so there's a place right down the street over here call Mike's Pub"
2," and on Friday she would always hang out there it was like it was a really weird little restaurant that was in a parking garage was really poor signage I want to see if they have one sign outside but yet to like go in a door go up a staircase open an unmarked door and that's where Mike's Pub was yeah I was like right"
2," but our office was here on Congress we are all the time too"
2," Mike's Pub would be up there"
2," man"
2," it's for me in my memory the place we always ate at or Mike's Pub"
2," the police called right over here and we would walk over if we had time we would walk over to the Whole Foods yeah I need at the Whole Foods those are the places I remember eating at the"
2," time"
2," about the"
2," you say that you talking about hat Creek remind me to go to the original the original there Torchy's trailer was right by Star Bar and what's in a Little Woodrow's was right there too so you can either pick up Torchy's or hat Creek for both"
2," start a note I think I think those are both of their original locations could be wrong about that but I think I think that's"
2," I'm going to guess around 6 or 7."
2," were very nice to we walked in and asked if we could use the theater without any heads up to The Hideout and they were very very"
2," all the time I mean multiple times a day getting"
2," at 6 to Congress and it was the one up over here at about 3 Starbucks"
2," here we come here all the time then we can do the I want to see the first live-action thing we found was those Captain Dynamic videos where we had ad from the Barenaked Ladies"
2," and I remember that day we were filming you know it came down you know I try not to catch a dynamic suit and we came here to get coffee and he was so in love with that suit in the character he stood out on Congress in front of the Idaho you're getting coffee in character talking to people and like going up to the pretending he was like Captain Dynamic aerial act like he was really embracing the character really getting a couple walking down the street I'm sure if you were trying to avoid him thinking he was like trying to shake him down for money or like to pose for photos or something like to talk to you on"
2," we are that office next door I'm thinking like talking about Captain Dynamic made me think about filming in that office and what a nightmare it was because the number for my perspective they were non-stop buses up and down Congress"
2," that building was built to look like one of these old historic buildings on Congress but it wasn't it was built in the 70s it's not it was not like a super super old building or nothing and the windows that face Congress had no insulation in them they would like the air would just go right in or write out so you could hear the bus is clear as day and in the summer and let the heat in like there was nothing there it's like you were standing outside and they never worked at one point called"
2," AC repair company out here to look at the AC and you know the way to get out there it's like you have to go through the bathroom open the window get out onto the roof and then cuz that's where the unit was the AC repair guy goes out there is out there for awhile it comes back and he's like yeah your your AC is totally dead going to need to put a new AC there we need to get a permit we need to close a lane of traffic when you get a crane to take the old air conditioner off the roof going to have to put the new air conditioner up they're going to order it and super super expensive more like fuk and then you know we're like a second opinion just to be safe, another company new company comes out and do cross out the window goes out to the roof and it comes back in one of you come with me"
2," and I would like I think I'm blocking all of us went out there I know I was out there and you know if we walk out there you know where the air conditioner is and he's like point that because look how much I wanted someone out here to this thing has been opened in years whatever guy you called before didn't even bother taking the cover off of this is that guy would look at it yet I don't know what's in there but I just want to show you it's just very clearly has not been opened in years and you don't screw that you know open it up you like the way I look this is just like a $200 fix Utica replace a couple of parts and put the cover back on and then they are"
2," it was a fixed a lot of to work for a little while longer"
2," I remember at one point we were filming something and there was like the lighting was like track lighting on the ceiling we're filming something and"
2," someone looked up like that smoke is there Haze or is there smoke like walking in front of those lights at the ceiling I don't know it looks like smoke with you smell smoke is it okay or do we need to call the fire department"
2," came and I just as a little bit of backstory here Jason found that office for us on Craigslist and like all of my house is available for a studio for someone to live in and we were"
2," running a business out of here with a lot of people in a lot of computers and extension cords running crisscross every works like with the with the way that these eight portable ACs for set up you couldn't draw too much power from anyone circuit breaker so that way to balance everything to not tripping the breaker is so fire department shows up like a couple of fire fireman walk up the stairs to our buildings and immediately they're just like looking at all of the electrical wiring on the ground I like following it to the walls and looking everywhere and they're like what are you doing you're like oh yeah they're going to the temperature gun and you know whatever equipment they have and they're like well there's no active fires no firing was no heat"
2," we have some concerns about the electrical in your"
2," it was definitely a nerve-wracking thing like being there and running a business out of that space which you know that building or that guy that used to be a Wendy's and yeah it was it was a Wendy's and I used to work at this wind is every now and then and for some reason they had an upstairs like you could order your food and everything downstairs and if the dumpster seeding was too. Some stairs in the"
2," the the pita place came in at least the place and renovated the downstairs to be a pita restaurant and we renovated the upstairs to be a studio and Jeff is not kidding the almost the entire upstairs where Studios used to be a bathroom it was like"
2," all urinals in toilets every where there were eight stalls"
2," that we reduced it down to one toilet and one"
2," red versus blue production back there we did some live action shorts back there if you ever saw that live action short about the World Cup for soccer we filmed that one back there where that people keep faking injuries and Nathan Felder tip coming into giving people yellow and red cards"
2," set a timer"
2," heard about you I'm a big fan of user manuals no really liking you electronic or something before I even wrap it or even try to set it up I love flipping through the manual to learn exactly how everything works all the buttons do all the ins and outs of it unfortunately life does not come with a user manual I wish it did but it doesn't but in place of a user manual perhaps maybe you could talk to better help to learn about online therapy and use that to help you out if it's like the next best thing to a man alright cuz you know I said like does it come with a manual so it's not working for you it's normal to feel stuck navigating in your life challenges can make you feel unsure whether it's a career change and new relationship become an apparent therapist are trying to help you figure out the cause of"
2," emotions and very productive coping skills which makes there be the closest thing to a guided tour of the complex engine called you better help has connected over three million people would like in Sierra Pacific I think it's great learning lots of skills to better cope or understand yourself I think it's really amazing how be stigmatized therapy has become and how it's it's it's okay to know too when you need to go talk to someone for help or an outside perspective as the world's largest therapy service better help his match 3 million people with professionally licensed therapist available online plus it's affordable to fill out a brief questionnaire to match of the therapist if these are not clicking you could easily switch the new therapist anytime couldn't be simpler no waiting room so traffic no endless searching for the right therapist learn more and saved my first met that betterhelp.com Emma that's better help h e l p.com enema"
2," I think we should I would I would hesitate to use the word best okay I think we were here at a major inflection point is I would phrase it just because that's the time we were here the Frost Bank Tower existed and the Austonian was under construction right after we"
2," and I felt like was the beginning of rush really tall buildings built downtown for a long time to Austin Skyline was really squat yeah"
2," it is it's funny how there's always that that counter-programming the counter event at Sundance head slamdance Southwest I can remember the names of the other festivals around here at the time but you're right though it were like long. What that despite the fact we're in an Entertainment District with a ton of bars you can go days without paying for a drink I think it's like just getting free beer and booze everywhere we were just lecturing South by specialty would be like all right we're going to walk down the street and take me to see how quickly I can get drunk"
2," so you talked about how every coffee shop you know had bands and events and what not including this one I wanted to point out on Rooster Teeth on one of the comments were previous episode someone said that they had their mind blown because their brother had just stubbed in as a drummer for four on the floor are episode came out yeah I'm at the hotel is"
2," how do I defend their faith in one of our listeners Brothers was just a drumming 44 on the"
2," cuz they're going to say it was it was non-stop I couldn't hit could not be avoided"
2," damn it"
2," it was a super thing man on receipts I don't know what the what the deal was just walking down the street or maybe we're kind of in the thick of it here like this is a very much on Nexus and there was a long run two homeless people having sex like right up against the side of a building"
2," was a"
2," could vary"
2," aggressive people in general very aggressive do not just necessarily homeless remember we kind of briefly talked about that one time we have to show him the draft house and they do try to fight me yeah as we were walking over to for do you know I did not I would literally just walking down the street I don't know what it is I got people think they can take me off"
2," was just like a cool or"
2," you know how you can tell like with somebody like an off-the-shelf suit versus with someone has a suit made specifically for them and they're measuring this dude had you can wear like everything was perfectly tailored on this dude it's just really really really well-dressed"
2," that being said our rent was ridiculous stupid cheap because I think they were shocked that anybody wanted to rent it out to begin with it was not a great spot and like I said was on Craigslist that's like a place to live needs to be renovated I want to see our rent was $2,000 a month"
2," I do remember that place yeah I mean"
2," romanticizing a lot of these places by the Royal"
2," search and all these places cuz there were a lot of shitholes to know if that had a dirt floor or was that building down on South Congress that was I think we talked about this already but it's not there anymore they was just like filled with people who are strung out electrical squatters like there was someone stay over by G&S Lounge Volt or it was"
2," while that place I remember we came close to Bill realize that like the next building over how hazardous chemicals and like that like all kinds of signs that if there was an explosion to run away"
2," I like poisonous gases could be released"
2," this is a great spot I think it really suit us well until if you know we had to move over we really by the by the end we were so packed and that officer was no space it was and it was a mismatch cable we had you know who said we said we had to balance our power needs because we're concentrating Breakers of ACS couldn't keep up"
2," yeah it was it was really brutal to get anything else done and if we were going to even act like even win Monte"
2," hey man I started you know working with us like there was no space for him which like rearrange things are crazy to even carve out a little bit of space for him to sit down and have a desk we"
2," despite all the downside it was"
2," a character I wonder how much like rose-tinted glasses I must also be talking about"
2," I kind of like a door that says do not enter and trying to like being on it and try to get in and out for me they"
2," across the front would be like torn down yeah"
2," a long time I would take the bus to work down here cuz I lived really conveniently on a bus line now take the bus here in the bus home and that was that was really great cuz I could you know just like relax on the bus for a little bit and not have to worry about stress of driving and parking but our hours were so erratic and we would work so late that lots of times like the bus wasn't running by the time I want to go home then there was just it just was untenable but one thing you did mention is the delos used to run at that time yeah it's like a free extension of the bus system and they would just run on a loop down six down Congress and the directions and just like you to be walking down the street like this just hop on it looks like a free bus you could the"
2," wait a minute it was a good times gone for a long time now"
2," coffee I think it's impossible for me to be objective about the coffee here it is so ingrained through so many years and such like big milestone to my life that I will always love the coffee here like it always triggers with memories and brings you back to that time"
2," of iced coffee"
2," I think that's that's so cool that's so great that you know people support local business like this"
2," I used to come here back when I worked at the old place before Rooster Teeth back in 2000 so it's like I don't I can't imagine The Hideout not"
2," lyrics"
2," we should I still live close out there and we did that first live stream video games in the EB"
2," yeah yeah"
2," wind comes out we are launching these at least that was the last I heard"
2," see if the taping the plan is for these to come out when this episode that you listen to right now comes out"
2," and I know you've been sent this a lot as well Eric people will speculate that maybe the capitalization of the letters in the Twitter name me some nights does that I had nothing to do with the creation of"
2," we do not know why so I saw some people I believe on rooster teeth were becoming desperate about the name and feeling like feeling like no progress has been made and I feel like enough time has passed now where I can say"
2," there have been some gases that have been so fucking clothes even not just posted on life but guess is that have been told to me in episodes have been"
2," at the time I didn't want to say anything the week after I wanted to give a little space to breathe but there weren't there have been some that works like almost backed by 99.9% of the way"
2," not too bad to look at him so I don't lose faith that this is going to"
2," in accounting I would say that's pretty much the same thing"
2," that's a good one"
2," costumes fighting with itself"
2," that's me"
2," it's a wonderful Journey we're all on together I just got to be like Rumpelstiltskin going to say it I'm going to fucking Screamin to figure out if we like"
2," 4th"
2," by then but we walked out of The Hideout the Japanese immediately turned the wrong way we walked Garage"
2," around a mall that is not coming back that's right"
2," do it was raining octopus owed to me, but it was still dry and warm this is literally actually raining right now so shut it but it was"
2," phone just said light rain about to"
2," brunch"
2," what's the point of the reason I don't like brunch is when you go to a restaurant and they're like oh we don't have the regular menu right now we have the brunch menu I don't fucking want that I want the stuff you serve 95% of the other time don't take away the food I want and give me some shity half breakfast half lunch that's an either if you're splitting your attention between two things you doing neither well"
2," station that would be"
2," listen Derek there's no way in which Jeff is wrong or it has been absolutely"
2," were back in a part of town that's changed a lot so we picked up coffee at venu over by Highland and Highland used to be a mall"
2," and is now a community colleges like the biggest Austin Community College location that there is and I think when you say Community College people might have like mental images of what a community college look like in most places our relationship ready to take a couple of small buildings you know this location of a c c b took over the mall it's like an old man didn't use the whole thing they put out parts of it"
2," High School apartments and Retail and everything in the area I and it's just such a strange Journey for the Hat real estate for the property area cuz I remember back"
2," you know when I first moved to Austin when I was younger to visit Austin all the time with family up here it was like there were two malls in 2L 4 months it was Highland and Barton Creek mall there was also Northcross Mall Lakeline in the Arboretum I don't know like how do I do want to cast your"
2," Mall Center"
2," think it's just the Guitar Center now"
2," most of Northcross mall I think the Guitar Center was part of North Cross mall if I'm remembering right and that might be like one of the only part that's left I think you're at but Highland Mall they kept most of it a little bit of it was demolished and I have been going to Highland Mall for decades and then you know, when did it close down it goes down"
2," whither away so I don't know who an ACC or who brokered that deal or who thought to redevelop it in this way it seemed insane at the time but seeing that sitting here now we're sitting close to it now in 2022 it was a really smart move it was really really a great idea I bet. The whole area is really benefited from the Redevelopment"
2," over-the-hill Creek that's not"
2," years. Move the university that move but then they just open up an apartment complex there the past couple months like that's a very scaled-back version of what was supposed to be built"
2," a little time to run up to the holiday"
2," on vacation I would like we're recording this right before Thanksgiving"
2," there off of an area"
2," crazy people looking for a place to live around here and we were repeatedly talked about how tough it has been a housing"
2," residence number you going to look up like what does Zillow say our occupancy"
2," from Jeff Goldblum"
2," a spanking Tanya"
2," but"
2," unavailable when I first moved to Austin as an adult back in January 98 I didn't have a job and had no prospects than welcome to do I was living sleeping on the floor of a friend of a high school friend studio apartment off of Riverside and that floor was not even that far is not even the floor had tons of roaches it was not great"
2," so I don't know what to do so and I grew up in a small town on the border I'd gone to college for a year in Houston but when you go to call just not really like living like you still kind of sheltered like this is my first time by striking out on my own coming Austin had no idea what I was doing a project same thing you did like open up the want ads you know it's the night he's really not much, but it was still like a new thing anyway you know what to do for a job open up the walnuts and then I was like fucking I was going to go to the mall and applied every store and so I came here to Highland Mall Highland Falls the one I went to yeah and I tried to apply to every fucking store in Highland Mall"
2," is it not enough for Smith and what"
2," one of my mind a lot of places open"
2," I was a Dillard's material which is worse"
2," when your tongue is long and"
2," you like now it starts Thursday"
2," I'm going"
2," tell you"
2," for"
2," I think it's just that time frame we're like a lot of Commerce moved on line in the mall started dying you know in the early to mid 2000s yeah and it just kind of withered away can a became a thing where there was no point in going it also had in town to have like a bad reputation he would say it was like a scary mall or the bad Mom I was wondering what that was that was"
2," never understood how many many times has a reputation built up that people are less inclined to go there for some reason I don't understand"
2," I did go to ACC briefly took it back to ACC really I want to first moved here I took a couple classes at AIU it"
2," Rio Grande campus dude a huge parking garage there now when I went back in 98 there was no parking garage there was just like one level of Street Lake surface parking in the lot was way too small for the size of that campus really"
2," but you have to show up early to try to find a spot and circle and then you have to walk up cuz it was like the the parking lot was down kind of behind where Austin Land and Cattle is like just a little east of air from there to go get to the actual campus that we took like two classes I think so did you complete your semester so you have you have grades I don't remember I really don't it's been 24 she wasn't in calculus"
2," a lot a lot lighter lot easier I think a cc is a real Gem and I think a lot of people in Austin appreciate it and I think people here understand what a value AC provide to the community if you live here like the rates are unbelievably good to take classes cuz your paper taxes and you can do really well you get if you don't get a degree there you can transfer to another College while but I mean it's totally a great place and I think that a lot of a lot of stuff going on"
2," back in 98 like I said I took one semester classes I was living off of Riverside and I didn't understand that there were many many campuses and some of them were very far away from me so I just like back then I don't think you could register online it was like you get like a printed catalog you flip through and then you would call the number and then register like they spawn codes that were associated with the courses and I didn't understand that in the codes it told you what campus it was at so I registered for classes at the Rio Grande one I would shoot for some like way up at the North one that close to Round Rock there's"
2," the way up to the driver"
2," whatever that road is"
2," tonight I do whatever the fuck that wrote that is"
2," well I mean you"
2," money disappear you're doing pretty well with the call center to you in advance pretty quickly and were making it even if this hadn't taken off you had success there I think maybe you were at work but I had like"
2," yeah that was crazy Time by then the"
2," I think that the very smartly started up Partnerships with Manufacturing in the area you know with Tesla on Samsung and Apple all in opening up very big Offices here I think they have partnered with all of them to do in a fast track training and accreditation course is to get people into that skilled Workforce when I think it's a very smart move on their part"
2," think a lot of that problem we're going to really talk about old Austin forever I think a lot of a source of that was the real Motel yes that was a huge yeah the real motel by itself I want to say was like 500 police called the real Motel was responsible for"
2," got people who want to drink and then end up wanting to fight"
2," have you been have you been in the ACC Highland building since they reopen it as ACC now"
2," these two have voting on this side I'm sorry to have it on the side by Benny went did they moved it to the back side back for the by where the Dillard's used to be on the back and actually do something and then they don't have voting here any more than they will get over to that city office just down"
2," request or I would just like I'm lunch go pick up something to eat and then go back to work"
2," I'm going to say something stupid like Sears"
2," but"
2," looks like what happened with Lucy In Disguise they own to the building South Congress was not a great place and they close down"
2," Canada 7 or 10"
2," carrot was when it was a Chick-fil-A there was a Wendy's it was like on the corner of the food court it's like didn't back up to a wall kind of back yeah I know how you open it for sure did not get hired 1990 nobody wanted to hire me"
2," was living at the Metropolis at the time thought that would have been like two thousand maybe 99 it was one of those primeco phones that everyone had at the time back on my cell phones first really started exploding"
2," I got that like someone look like after like the kind of chunky boy bore was able to get one cell phone you get when they first came out and then like a year later there were three of it and now it just leads me to think that there was a moment of time where that we lived through words like you went from being unreachable wherever you went to now you're like tether to a fuck you can be reached at anymore"
2," time. Like a personal problem and now I can't"
2," didn't they pay for stuff like that they subsidize cell phones for us for a while to make sure that we were we were on call it available yeah I forgot about that"
2," oh well but that phone for so the silver so shity but even applied to I think I think I might go to Pinky's actually that way I don't remember it's been it's been a quarter-century since"
2," Yeah. I think that was the last pink it was like a local cell phone store chain which doesn't exist anymore but now it's all like the carriers operate the the store but I would like a place you go and buy a phone and buy a plan like I sold all the phones and all the different terrorist weird to think about now"
2," that's not like I can figure out"
2," something about your face"
2," I thought about it"
2," different jobs I hope three of them were kind of customer customer facing one of the weirdest one I would say it's probably work in an office supply store in Eagle Pass the small town I grew up on the border is an office supply store but I didn't work selling the office supplies at work off to the side at the Beeper counter and I could sell people deepers I could tell people deeper plans and I could repair beavers like I'd like I'd like to live no training to do this it is hired me in their life for the people repair guy"
2," most of the time the problem so there were a couple of different things I could be wrong right"
2," there were a couple of different carrier problem like your beeper is not receiving signal is not receiving the pages so I had a list of different carrier phone numbers like not publicly available phone numbers for the different paper carrier that you would call and I talked to one of the technician to be like you know here's the serial number on this beeper it's not getting service for some reason and they would just like you deleted from your system. It got caught now it's working it's just like the customer doesn't have the number to call because they want the character going to be on the customer calls that are pointless like I would have to troubleshoot this a carrier product called the carrier from fixed the other problem would be like my beeper doesn't vibrate anymore like it just makes a buzzing noise you know when these are the two biggest Palace ever in so then when that's a problem you just take it apart and normally you pick the way that a beeper vibrates and buzzes it's like a haptic"
2," be back in a controller it's just like a little cylindrical weight if I have a cylinder and there's like a motor that that spins it around and it's only half a cylinder is like it's off center in the whole thing kind of vibrate the motor with contact paper so dirty you keep in your pocket or anything else like sometimes it would be like it doesn't turn on the circuit circuit boards bad swap it out with a different one to that one working out here you go charge you Thirty or forty bucks or whatever the"
2," amazing how much I wasn't"
2," do you like take apart and second off I also worked when I was at Rice I had I took a job on campus there I worked at the AV department at the University and that was that was weird because it's like it was fielding and fulfilling AV requests for faculty so it's like a fresh will be like I need a projector in this room for this class cuz I want to be but for whatever reason it's like you just like to keep inventory on everything but I got to make sure that this piece of Hardware is in that room at this time and then go pick it up and then we also owe the light burned out in this projector or in this in this overhead projector in this film projector know what kind of lightbulb does it take me to have like a big inventory of different light bulbs everything use a fucking different bulb in his match in the ball of and swapping it out really easy"
2," and then I also worked at a lawyer's office for a while for like a summer I was I was Dolores my perception is so that was just like taking phone calls putting stuff on the calendar greeting clients that they're kind of like"
2," you've ever had that's those three and then just call center and then brush your teeth"
2," a little"
2," scorekeeper for a few years kind of ruined baseball little bit for me because now all I can to sound like a dick when I see you play like 25-30 have you ever been"
2," but when I also worked at the other place I really got a"
2," fired"
2," I"
2," like one of the things we will go there till like"
2," but she could be a good podcast like talking to people to Salon just catching up on Urban fired"
2," if"
2," so many places you can apply to it once ya"
2," you said you said"
2," the hottest cup of coffee with ever been made I"
2," but we're like the same like at books and what not but it was still loud it was it was vibrant and Alive"
2," I don't know what"
2," and they were like the little temporary one there"
2," the reason I wanted to stick with something I could find everywhere not get like a weird fancy drinks I don't want to be getting something different on different things that"
2," it's a 63 degrees in here"
2," pretend like they do I swear they don't Bakery cosplayers"
2," keep it"
2," I'm trying to see how it fits now"
2," I'm not even enough room in the building"
2," dream dream like the lot of these make too much sense"
2," to me that doesn't make sense to me that clever and then you got"
2," we're going non-canon for a couple weeks"
2," supplementary episodes that are not core episodes up the release date was on this one doesn't make any sense"
2," I'll see you next week then whenever we record"
2," I'll see you next week then whenever we record"
1," I have no trouble keeping track of that Cannon and fanfiction"
1," tiny is a misnomer"
1," magical Winter Wonderland you can go to the diner you can go ice-skating if it gets a little too cold ice skating you move inside so no"
1," and it came all busted the b i I Met tickets Lee glued the roll"
1," it's two poodles so that's where"
1," of town on the back side is where her dressmaking shop is where she works"
1," goes House of a dragon would be a totally different show if they had pugs"
1," on Instagram the other dates of a pug asking for help in a bathtub what's the saying the word help"
1," all colors Dragon I felt like learned a lot"
1," dragon so I I must admit my complete and utter ignorance I'm only going on"
1," images that I've seen gas refuses to watch shows like White Lotus which bad people just"
1," because"
1," the rich is there a charge"
1," an episode of our teapot to counter that show premiered I made this exact same point about how I did not want to watch the show for that reason but"
1," so it was especially early on I felt like that show did not do a good job as far as like a conclusion I understand it's a fantasy world but if it's ready to roll you do whatever you want why restrict yourself so much rivalry makes Anthony has bugs me about sci-fi especially when it's like whatever I felt like houses Dragon really did lip service it felt like they were doing lip service initially to that but then that kind of changes as I know goes on but I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised"
1," pivotal part of the"
1," thank you"
1," yesterday as"
1," gets stuck every once in a while and we'll get off the track and you have to wait for the magnets come back around I saw it gets stuck for a little while"
1," so really it's like when you watch the the DVD of all nice local brew this"
1," Cafe"
1," give me the first time we saw mill Cafe this actually good segue 4-story"
1," Eric. My phone"
1," no I have no memory of this at least, we thought it was the dumbest thing in the world it was when we took that trip to Australia back in 2004 on the street I remember what street it was one of those"
1," look at the map I could probably point out where it was more or less but we walk through Melbourne and there was like outdoor seating at the McDonalds and like cafe-style what is that in the person we're with my coffee and stuff stupid want to have like a cafe type of experience in McDonald's and in the next year it was"
1," him to but if you get them Emily doesn't drink anymore but really but"
1," like an out and your drink and"
1," pretty small town free internet so you any any any probably non-english-speaking town as well so I spent a lot of years speaking English with a very distinct very Regional accent and I do my best to shake it off but it does irritate every now and then I had to beat this"
1," would like in High School playing basketball when I'm talking and it's like I'm like Kenneth in 30 Rock to"
1," back I used to have this problem taking her somewhere"
1," problem or anytime I would go back home"
1," and visit my grandfather I would slip into it like"
1," slipped into an unintentional without meaning to but then he died and so I don't any more"
1," like just instantly when I was around him I was just like a ten-year-old Southern kid"
1," all up pretenses and everything is going to Falls away when you're around somebody myself anything so important your whole life"
1," saw on day one people of Southern Accents get bullied more and made fun of more and shit on more and so I was like I'm going to I'm just not going to talk"
1," problem"
1," my voice in the Army for a little while if I was just I realize like if I open my mouth I'm going to punch it's the Persistence of accents to this day it really because now we have so much media so readily available to us from everywhere for the same reason I did like there was a lack of access to communicate with people who have different accents who didn't have an accent now it's like you can watch YouTube or whatever the fuck to talk whatever all day long and hear how other people speak like a very big role in that audio script podcast restricted beneath beneath"
1," I did like five lines it was a very tiny roll mostly because I have a doctor's dogshit at voices are more than me and"
1," endure accent from like pet never heard of that one"
1," 20 minutes of interviews with people from that area and then I was able to do it but a long time ago we kind of work with the dude from that are you probably didn't work them as much as I did unlike the server side of things and like the web development side of things like way back in the doors his name"
1," we are going to get a first name"
1," I had to talk with him on a semi-regular basis that the only reason I'm familiar with without sound like when you mention not that 2004 Australia slip into something I didn't remember the McAfee thing at all but what I do remember from the same day but how do we say that"
1," 2004 we was Australia I was blown away because they had figured out how to pay for parking with your phone already"
1," 2014 then we got the name"
1," this number to this number show up on your phone bill"
1," instead you know it said that with you but they were doing that they were fishing out of their pocket change as far back as 2004"
1," end of the year face supplemental we did we just figured out how to make tap-to-pay work this year I swear"
1," that's the frustrating thing that's the frustrating thing"
1," country are used to be before this year it's like you go and they have the term look like you try to type that doesn't work"
1," tape that says tap broken have to"
1," to tap"
1," bro"
1," a I had a Simpson thing happened to me the other day that's work-related I think I can tell the story I was doing a meeting with some of the executives in like for an outside agency they were having a little like"
1," and I were the guy I guess that you were unavailable at"
1," so it had to be me"
1," be in this meeting but we're in the two-week period where he doesn't do and the so you can't."
1," Anyway so I was doing on zoom on my desktop here and then I have to leave in Zoom I have to leave to go get Millie and so I'm like I'll just hop up over on my phone for the last like 20 minutes this meeting will go get my kid and I switched over and ride as I come in I hear Adam who's like the head of marketing by Emily what's that and then I just see your screen name and I realize"
1," went through it and just didn't I didn't I was just like yeah"
1," if you're up I was in a meeting I would have had your back I appreciate it I appreciate it"
1," of that other place we did some things like that name your phone that then you think like this is going to be embarrassing and you think that's why I have to keep it and so then you're driving around in the car with Emily's dad and you switch over"
1," and he looks at it and you look at and you got to go like"
1," here's the deal I feel like most people just keep the generic name to their phone he's whatever comes to like iPhone 14 or 13 or Internet telephone 14 professional maximum"
1," we're not"
1," mall but"
1," did I prove this"
1," two things"
1," back, I feel like I've done five times but I will say when I took Millie for the mall the other day and I was like the kids. We walked into the food court I'm right here"
1," mall I hope they all didn't fall over dead I mean they got caught in the mall"
1," guess I was here like 5 minutes early you were already here fucking here pretty"
1," into where I am"
1," because there was a malfunction I had to come here and deal with while you were out of town so I have like like I was very nervously approaching the house so I was like that's my only experience with his house elec OK Google make sure I don't fuck anything that was very anxious about about approaching the house"
1," Puerto Rico we were worried it would affect our friendship and then we realize we hung out just as much when I was in Austin and he lived in Puerto Rico is ever"
1," don't know if you noticed about me but I'm a weird anti-social"
1," that's that's that's what I got"
1," marred at all by the fact that we don't visit each other outside of work"
1," fucking 15 years together we have spent a lot of sitting next to each other"
1," it's been a lot of"
1," a lot of working at even before RoosterTeeth the call center and all that other shit"
1," so we are we live together off of Riverside a couple of times"
1," I want to say sorry but one of them robbery to but yeah maybe three sometimes I moved back from Puerto Rico win a people's kind of really taking off and like I was I was going to be the first person like dedicating all my attention to it cuz Bernie and Jeckle still working at the call center so I didn't want to have to pay rent because I didn't do things and go away overnight so just let me live in his spare bedroom and I also bought the cheapest vehicle I could which is why I bought that old 64 pick up that broke down all the time what you talked about for the very gracious but that's kind of where"
1," that's what I think I was a lot of the time we spent together because I was living there and then you know he would go to work and when he was done with work and come home and work on red versus blue risky stuff for hours or I go over to Bernie and we don't work on it there so it was either going to Bernie's building stuff or staying at Jeff's house and fulfilling store orders"
1," were on this cycle a real quick just what are the second RoosterTeeth started to take off and became like a job we all put money time and effort into and it became real work us like I'm going to Puerto Rico. You guys are in that way how we were dated all of that and it was already was already a date on the calendar and I wanted February the show didn't"
1," we had a little well I can say what you did was just ask Jeff had a little room that we retrofitted as an office it was probably a little smaller than this room that we're two desks in there in the corners and set up you know our computers to like a email and work and do whatever else I had like"
1," Xboxes and no TV so we can play video games at the same time or you know whatever we needed to do and it's like our first foray into like trying to set up an official Works Bayside I loved that lay in bed is set up and I think that we try to recreate it for a little while when we worked in the Buda apartment because our desks were still kind of side-by-side but the room was bigger so it wasn't like we were butted up against each other it was great too because there were it was a time when there were so few of us working or something came up and I couldn't take care of it you just like her and be like hey what's this thing or give me a hand with this and it's like Bank stuff out"
1," contribution to"
1," of red versus blue was written in Bernie's home office and in which house like you know like which domicile contain the most amount of effort of work"
1," for the project and that home office where Gus and I are start I guess early on the day the"
1," entire website was written there the message boards all that stuff was made in that home office between you and I over the period of about a year and like and then we moved on and you know who knows who the fuck using that office for right now but I was thinking I like like like a red vs blue. Cam was born in that room while I was really drunk Gamers and set it up for ugly internet and drunk anymore so it went through three Productions before we have found a successful one"
1," ever know at least one forward every piece of face I ever record is in this room unless it's off to stay you know and I'll be like the totality of the I guess like of the of the story of this room is like this in the face for the first"
1," I replayed a video game in high-definition was in that office I had an Xbox with the HD component cable adapters and it was Soul Calibur 2 and it was a lot of it was a tiny little HGTV that I bought it like Best Buy it was like the Michael Scott TV in the office"
1," in it was like $1,500"
1," video games in high-definition and it was so fucking cool but it was only like 7:20 p.m."
1," despite the fact that was Tiny and you have that other weird fucked up TV that EDTV number that I did eventually get so Jeff had this back in the early days of flat screens just bought like this flat screen and it was like"
1," 30in maybe 32 in and it was it wasn't an HGTV it was an LED TV and I don't even remember what that means do you know I was hoping you would"
1," it but it was designed for like corporate shit wasn't consumer"
1," what is it"
1," I remember that fucked up all the"
1," and it had like fucked-up input like it had an SDI inputs like stuff like that stood like a corpus of Jeff talked about like shit you would never use in it looks"
1," was there was a Sony Sony Sony HD TV I paid $3,000 for this what I ever said I wanted a flat screen TV and cortical flat screens falling off the wall by those are the early days of that technology that she was so fucking expensive and"
1," X SSL"
1," we got into an Animal Crossing GameCube"
1," or why we decided to pick it up or Circle we were doing a website called drunk Gamers where we played in reviewed video games drunk and so we it was just they came out doing everything you know on the train but it's like the first character you meet like when you're going into the town and you have to draw the like the character with a cat with a blank space and you have to draw a face on the cat and then it would be like a recurring character you see every now"
1," and we just"

1," how do you say pretty quick but we did it for years"
1," reason it's weird to me but you know now that I'm older and make sense it's weird that how there's like different parts of downtown of the different bars that caters like different clientele is uh through the ecosystem it's like you start out dirty sex that you moved to like the east side he moved to West 6th or you go down to the warehouse District like there's different guys your age and your interest you go to different areas of bars and drink there in a weird place to drink in Austin is right now I think in terms of like bar scene or that I think it's the domain but they have like their version of 6th Street up there in a truck over here is Rock Roe's and it's like you got on there like midnight and it's no different than 6th Street Garner ever been up there"
1," Diamond Loch apartments at"

1," Instagram there we go beginning of this podcast episode will make sense and"
1," would guess is it online I don't say anything"

1," put on full blast"
1," we are at the food court we came to get a cup of Starbucks coffee because we had to get rid of it was full of it was full of boxes and no food no food"
1," girls that were working there that were very confused about what coffee they were about to make the Pike's Place and they said that's what this is and I'm tasting it and no it's not so we wanted to come to the mall because this is our third season"
1," in the mall is back has been on a mullet back kick we are in the food court next to a Marble Slab Creamery a Chick-fil-A a Charley's Philly cheesesteaks Panda Express Jalisco's Taqueria Ruby Thai Kitchen"

1," damn I don't remember most of those games that you read sound made up enjoy spelled m i don't"
1," mission of meeting instead well he did really well"
1," what are weird"
1," because you came to this very mall and got an act"
1," I think it"
1," so you guys came to this small was this like the like the mall to come to Earth Fleet there were three for"
1," here"
1," I mean some things and some things begin thank you for watching the last episode of Seinfeld"
1," it why are the mall is back has been a thing you keep saying I don't you just came here often because you're like oh it's raining out what I need to walk around yes I've been trying to get in wedding shape you know"
1," just blown away to find out that it was back"
1," 10 a.m. so is this how it was when you were here the other day or is it only a few days away before Christmas do you know"
1," we"
1," do you remember that"
1," oh man I mean you've been doing this for so long is it just in jokey stuff like but like strictly for yourself"
1," yeah sometimes a"
1," doing that"
1," I mean when I remember when we were launching these things or whatever and it's so out of the Wheelhouse for like what RoosterTeeth even does at all just thought I'd take a stab at something like what if we did a true crime podcast but it's in the sky like oh yeah let's try it and immediately white people picked up on it"
1," do a throw-in but so far from everyone by the time this comes out you'll know if we have one made for projects that I guess around projects that are like really out of the Wheelhouse or like regular sort of stuff of like how"
1," Rooster Teeth started but start of what it's become is just this kind of podcast entertainment cigarette but like this is always what it has been at its core and so doing it in like this medium really make sense cuz that"
1," years ago"
1," we got"
1," can I tell you something sure the signal words"
1," they are people who split off from the Webby Awards the people who founded the Webby Awards and the signal award is from them so maybe a real real"
1," but in some ways it's because"
1," I guess how would you feel if you did win these this it would you feel like this is a Redemption for you"
1," I don't know about that"
1," for black or black"
1," you anything like that I'm meeting"
1," it's all you people all the time"
1," see if if face gets to"
1," but it kind of to me it kind of"
1," the moment that"
1," when you guys started I mean going back again I guess we're sort of on this topic podcast drunk tank is what started all of this stuff to bring it to RoosterTeeth podcast which is an unending Behemoth of 700 + episode"
1," so this is what I wanted to speak to start the podcast out of spite and also you think I should still be called he can disagree"
1," people have been asking to podcast bread been around"
1," and now it's been seven hundred something"
1," if you make something you don't have to release it like"
1," and then now it's been 14 years and you'll do"
1," right every every time there's a new episode of face it's Jeff Goin I only got like one thing to talk about so you guys are really going to carry the load and then we don't even get to the one fucking thing he has a talk about it's like why do you prepare anyting"
1," I asked if you wanted to sit in the"
1," funny that"
1," looking at some future topics that I know we wanted to get to eventually but I don't know if these are any of the ones that you guys want to talk about you feel like if we want something warm all Centric but I do the one I'm curious about the most and you not talk about this now aren't you the day we took me on Yahoo"
1," is that something you want to talk about so well I I"
1," we would have this thing that would happen"
1," but there was a time when the whole company"
1," six"
1," how do you do that how you take down fucking dogs are really good question in what year was that 2006"
1," point a juggernaut not for that you"
1," trying to kind of hide that's a little bit"
1," there's some related stories I could tell about"
1," oh yeah yeah"
1," but there were other"
1," buy we are approached by Microsoft"
1," was like oh this is great"
1," it was it was a lot"
1," at the time that we're"
1," that were great we should go sit down watching 240 Red versus Blue on a give xplayer to tell it looks the best it"
1," that like me my eyes roll back in like that gave me like a sensory experience they give it that was like wow holyshit"
1," here's exports for 30"
1," I will say that though it does exports that's what age Bernie"
1," all my god wow"
1," crazy crazy awesome"

1," okay with the name is fully in English"
1," there is no word that starts with m"
1," don't know if we ever said that we have not we have not confirmed or denied that a little"
1," thank you I love that thank you after a revised guess as we know that it's likely to be something similar to the later guesses like episode 25 and"
1," and my podcast and he's compiled a Google list list and if it's confirmed episodes in everything that we have here and wow key factors thank you Wolf Pen Creek whooping Creek gas is Austin memory Association in it but I had to guess it because I don't think Rick was the 10K here's some other gases Stefan says I know where assholes and I guess what there's no end"
1," all right right right buddy and me some Migos from Mike"
1," exactly there's a lot of people people are mostly guessing stuff that starts with Austin"
1," Austin American thank you Nadia good guesses not there"
1," rick another matter I am trying to find anything okay this is from mr. Goodman"
1," all my Austin we know it's not that armadillo Ali-A name"
1," sorry. So and he got this from you did somebody say any more assholes"
1," on Instagram and on Twitter and keep up-to-date with what it looks like when we record you can check out the pictures from Tiny Town and then I really good stuff so here we are at the mall wrapping this one up we're going to go do another Mall episode go to the mall I guess"
1," cleanliness of the stable this is much better than the food court that being said there is like shit all on the floor there they might be a little late on the floor"
1," at the mall is back it just hasn't made its way back here"
1," there was a week we got coffee"
1," I guess the rewards Affinity program for Nordstrom is called the Nordy club which seems like the dumbest Louis effort I"
1," what would you call it I don't know that's what the Nordstrom bombers what was Wilbur Nordstrom's nickname maybe we can call Nordstrom Nordstrom Chrysler Daimler Benz"
1," chocolate chip muffin that is like cement it is so chocolatey it is a little undercooked maybe I don't know before but just wanted to get a muffin I was hungry so I got them animal crackers"
1," crackers"
1," call when I think of animal crackers what animals do you think of an animal cracker"
1," probably a monkey elephant zoo animals right now yeah hippo for me"
1," I also think of giraffes only get the rights to those animals"
1," those other animals locked down an elephant fill out of there"
1," bag of Skittles you don't expect to get flavors that are on the back right in the package I don't see what you're getting"
1," eyes there's the problem I just see it now no artificial flavors or preservatives where the BMO you got to get more GMOs in your animal"
1," equivalent to Starbucks Coffee size compared to Starbucks cold coffee is very good"
1,"we're we're definitely in the mall and it's making me think you know we thought we talked about going to that GameStop and buying you know the Xbox when it first came out it's making me think and I said you know I live right across the highway from here to make me think a lot back on those times and I would have been like late 90's early 2000's actually that time in my life and I don't remember this but maybe it made me think about the things that I would do at that time you know we spend time together playing video games what I like"
1," specifically around the time that we were working at the call center I felt like I was always tight for money like I was I was trying to fight me we talked about like having side hustle trying to find other ways to make money and then we talked before about like reading through the chronicle and find free movies and free booze and stuff like that and I remember one time seeing an ad for that was like research study get paid get paid $500 or some shit and I was like oh I could do that but"
1," Austin for medical research and I was like all this isn't a medical one this is like some research Focus Group whatever I remember I applied and they selected me and I went and this is something this is the first the very first time I read it if I tried to get into this is like a racket for a bit cuz it was good money in it but why didn't you cuz I never"
1," manhole"
1," play continuing or did you get burned out I felt like they stopped calling me the first time I ever did it but there was like a marketing research focus group and they met at the Radisson over there I guess it's the line hotel now that like Cesar Chavez and Congress and they rented out one of those like meeting rooms and it was like that like the big meeting table like eight people in there and I was one of them they will collect it from the ad in the chronicle and they showed us like"
1," they wanted to make and they wanted to know what we thought of the commercials and the products and supposed to be this person I remember it was four Mike's Hard Lemonade Mike's Hard Lemonade come out yet this is like the first ad they were going to make to like introduce Mike's Hard Lemonade to the world and they wanted like everyone's experience it and they might have to pick because I drank a lot like one of the questions they ask at the table they were all like talking about like the different places I could go for happy hour and all the special remember one thing about this I remember you coming home and saying I found people that really drink it would be worth some serious drinkers there and they showed us a story boards for some ol Mike's Hard Lemonade commercial for like a bear chasing the guy up a tree and then like some other guy steals does Mike's Hard Lemonade out of Orlando came in a woman tricking my car"
1," falling over themselves, how great it is and how they would drink it up I miss you stupid like one of your products is awful to the commercial does not make me want to drink this call me back but it was not there when we're done to give me like a $500 Best Buy gift card I was like this is the easiest money I've ever made in my life into it and more than a handful more of these focus groups but I don't know why I think it back I don't know why I didn't give us cash that must have been some legality think we'd like to have to pay us in gift cards or or some other cash equivalents but"
1," the kind of Splendid idea okay that we that we acted on so we did this focus group with all these people who I said these are people really drink and like some of them a couple of them started like sharing stories like if you go to this place on this day they have cheap drinks or if you go to this place on that day you can drink real cheap and"
1," I remember that kind of fucking idea that I talk about with Jeff that we tried to put together you will like these guys have figured out the cheapest place to drink alcohol in Austin every day of the week erect they haven't plowed it out and they know the exact cheapest drink in town on any given day at any given time today and that's where they are as a budding alcoholic at the time you fill project was we wanted to put it all together and build a website call Austin drinkers we're now whenever you would visit it would tell you at that moment what the cheapest drink in town"
1," Tuesday at 4 p.m. because they have Dollar well"
1," for baby."
1," around the farc started having meet up and took off a whole life of its own. But I'm going to get around to the front right to an but is is a direct result of"
1," just to pull this off we need the knowledge of every Bar in Austin right we need to visit every single Bar in Austin that we started meeting every far is he with the beginning of Rooster Teeth and other stuff we had going on so we tried to go to Every bar in town and I remember we kind of gave up on that at some point we shelved the idea and then that eventually turned into US wanted to go eat at every hamburger restaurant in town but then some fucking"
1," it and so they were reviewed every the restaurant we didn't do that but that eventually 20 years later turned into wanted to go to Every coffee shop in town which is what this podcast from"
1," baby we were going to go to the"
1," and had a ton of friends in from out of the out of town in the country and so he set up a scavenger hunt and Austin scavenger hunt and everybody split up into teams and you had to let go and take photos of these things run time coolest way to introduce people to a new city in Spanish"
1," go to Dan's Hamburgers"
1," friends no no I think I moved here after"
1," the friends of the friends sign like the three-dimensional friend later at the Burger she's a in a yard over in cherry wood some over the"
1," torches down there it's like local Austin Burger chain has been around for decades Fran and dad got divorced in"
1," Restaurant Story like the same thing though they got divorced and they split the managers up and then they all went under yeah I didn't know that Dan and Fran yeah and Dan still going strong"
1," I can think of one off of Airport. I might do that all the time and"
1," yeah"
1," more that I would go to all the time the time the drive-thru sucks because they do a thing but I think a lot of other burger places don't do like last time to go to burger place you like"
1," I'll take a single or double or triple stack more Patties on but a dance you order your burger you order like a small or medium or large and they just make the Patty bigger and bigger taking one patty size and stacking it on top of a top of itself to make a bigger Burger story"
1," that's how much of a story one time I was still married to my first wife we went into your friends when they like on a Saturday back in the old days you spend a"
1," like window shopping and I guess people do now too but it's way more crowded it was a much more like local Friendly place at the time there were a lot of like like parts and labor with my still exist somewhere but it did just cater to only local establishments and great great old antique stores that no longer exist unfortunately or have moved around and we sat down and I heard we were sitting next to Dennis Quaid and his family is that I would just like a Herberger's left"
1," 2001 maybe yeah hell yeah and then nine short months"
1," you don't see that a lot didn't like"
1," do you know Alexis place you mentioned Hilbert stands like they're from an old guard riding started a long time ago they're still around I feel like you're have been knew or franchises are you were businesses to start in Austin that do take that explosive growth route likely Terrace like PT Terry's just started now they're everywhere changed it or Nationwide if not very close Pete Terry's Rudy's is all over the Southwest Torchy's Torchy's"
1," everywhere anywhere that I can think of is everywhere Taco Bell on Barton Springs Mexican restaurant on bar has huge Freebirds Rudy's isn't iodine"
1," bread beloved I should say was it still exists kind of and it will exist again but it was a really successful Bakery there everybody loved that in the early 2000s just to just spending like crazy like 13 locations and then they got overextended and they got into some financial trouble and they end up having to close the mall I don't know about like one of the sons was like a lawyer in New York and you like moved home to help figure it out in like took over anyway they they end up going down to just one Texas French bread which is over by UT it's at Guadalupe or whatever just"
1," they closed all but one and then they reorganized they turn into the bakery it's a really cool thing where"
1," supper club and that was very successful I thought either cuz I'm so I can never get reservations and then last or earlier this year burn down like six months ago I got caught fire burned out we launched operations and they are trying to get like the bakery business back up while they like we do we build a building is another one is a pretty popular pizza restaurant that they like I was like four or five five locations are so what 3 is now that they built those apartments and that retail on the first floor there was that one over on Lake Austin as well over by like"
1," Deep Eddy Cabaret there's one over on Mesa on there was one by the domain off of Duval up there I would say some others that are still around that are not what they were killing ants Pizza you don't see a lot of those around anymore there's going to be a lot really Double Dave's pepperoni rolls and I went to Riverside all the"
1," top of it I told a story in a podcast once I think about a couple not understanding how the automated, right I'm thinking of a place that was not a chain or that maybe not even very popular"
1," Goodcents"
1," I know the name it was a sandwich place off of Riverside you get the nickel or the time that was gone early 2000 super cheap ways to love eating at all the all the time he was so close to where we live and work at the time there's a lot of stuff in that shopping complex there like that that one day off of Riverside for that where the movie theater used to be where the Chinese food buffet is now yeah that's right over there mr.

1," several premieres and shows at the Lincoln Center in New York which is like wild to me I thought one of the first screens we didn't public was like a season 1 screening in the mirror season two we did at the Lincoln Center up in New York, Scott together first a lot of us really saw the community Gavin was there it was about how like his people for people and it just wild to me that you know it's like such a prestigious place would you like the Lincoln Center in like we're playing are like dick jokes on on-screen there I rather think it was wild the"
1," the week after we were leaving they were having an airing of Lord of the Rings with the entire cast and it was the first time the entire cast have been together since the movie came out and watch it together and I remember thinking like how the fuck are we on the same stage as a Miss which seat has huge now but at the time was like so much bigger than it was like brand new stator on a different level I feel like I felt like I'd be a lot like that imposter syndrome creeping in the Lincoln Center I remember we did a screening you were there with me after we what do we do the screening at IMAX in San Jose's in like a a science technology Museum and even going to Acme in walk in and like you walking this beautiful building it's like the Crazy Design and like the first of you walk in and eat lychee"
1," on the stage where they film the Academy Awards remember though yeah it was before the show was before the Academy Awards they had a like the seat fillers they had like printed out faces of different actors and actresses when was I have a picture of Millie sitting next to the Kevin Hart when because he was like her fairies our favorite celebrity be able to very fortunate to go to like a lot of these like really religious places and I think pretty quickly that even prestigious places have have to fill seats at some point"
1," play 365 days a year program thing"
1," just remembered that while we were there for that cuz we didn't realize and then age live 20 times at this point but I remember that one was also interesting at the Dolby Theater because we had a little bit less room in the behind the curtain because they were about to film the finale of America's Got Talent"
1," and they had all the props and shit all the America's Got Talent like Signs and sit in the back story and that's what we have is like tights faces"
1," remember that that first let's play live we did here in Austin ACL theater because that's when I ran event I was like organizing all of that shit money did you lose a lot of money"
1," remember was it $100,000 more I never left the building. It wasn't your phone if I am I walked fifteen Miles that date entirely in the theaters yeah so much running around and organize shit and get shit together I thought I was going to die at the end that show was over and it was it was a great show I was like one of the the coolest things I think we've ever put on what what"
1," a technological nightmare to do all of that"
1," what we were doing had never really been done in that way before at that time at least that's my understanding here and so there was a lot of like questions as to whether we can pull it off technically and so just had to do a lot of work to find I'm speaking for you a lot of work to find the right the right"
1," cuz we were having to live switch between 6 Xboxes 6pcs 6 Nintendo switches at the same time on screen and display it and then we have a Twitter wall and set up you want to have the pictures here like where it was very complicated and the company that said that they could do it was very expensive like 2 weeks before the event yeah just got cold feet and back out and said nevermind it can't be done we can't do it and just abandoned us"
1," Flynn from around the country like experts said he could find they can push it off for February 2015 some of the hardware we needed to do all of this routing was so expensive I like there's one particular piece of Hardware that only three don't lie three of the entire state of Texas and I needed all three of them yeah I had to get all three of these Hardware in from Indianapolis to you how to use a hardware and it was just a nightmare of finding very specialized people to do this very ambitious project which is why when you see a h live now it is it's the profitable version of what we created with my life like it down to one group so we have to fly less people in this less expensive and it's down to a lot of prop comedy"
1," how does improv which they have more fun doing on stage anyway and then single player co-op vs on a single box verses on a switch most likely be overcooked a lot of fall guys live that kind of stuff because it's so much technologically it it's so much cheaper and easier when that other company quit you know I was in crisis mode and I we had a meeting with my boss is at the time and I was like listen we can cut all of this stuff like trying to create us of a virgin to show that you're talking about like if we just redo the entire program we can cut all these think that this thing maybe we can make this work will you bring the sink on in under budget and remember someone looked me in the eye and said fuc the budget and I said I want you to email me that I need proof that you said that because this is incredibly expensive to do the show that you want that's on paid on paper right now"
1," I know it isn't. It was a good person and we learned so much and we learned that the next time and the next time and now you know I don't I think my days are participating in the Rover but they'll keep doing Hy or some version of that and they've got it down to a science now that's awesome I'm very functional to learn a lot a lot a lot different careers in the span of working at this company so much different weird knowledge very specialized lots of times that"
1," they wouldn't do it again"
1," it was like a huge stress relief all of this has been building up to that day right I guess it's going to work is it going to happen they finally it actually did get executed I think I wanted to cry the entire next day it was like letting off the pressure valve you know it's done we did it at work people like if you had a good time good feedback from like leaving people from the parent companies had showed up at the parent company super pressed have no idea how you did it at the time a T and T is like it was an amazing show likes thank God I remember I remember conversations"
1," the campfire you dude you're a"
1," incredibly expensive if that company hadn't backed out at the 11th hour with the prom and that's how he got fucked it was going to be a break even at that point we were going to lose a little bit"
1," everybody that you just named is an absolute superstar in this company that I cannot speak highly enough especially Patrick Salazar gas but I just can't say enough good things about but God damn Adam Baird environment doing a live show you what she"
1," a beauty to watch Legend Center we have this idea for Center Stage like a big focal point and we could look at its huge stage with a bunch of a kind of like the list and never really done anything against never said this is different than it was really really new technology and it wasn't working"
1," it was like the doors are about to open it's Friday morning nothing's working the stage is just like dark not a single thing on it works Adam Baird had slept like in two days and he's up there and five minutes before the door opens he fixes it and everything like we like pasta life and everything turns on like literally minutes before the doors open I was like thank God Adam bear to see her to like sort untangle everything sort it all out and put it all back together and sticks it"
1," what is it the 6 months is summer"

1," secure like from North Loop heading north and you and I would refer to it as like one of the last bits of what was left of old off like that section and northloop down over there"
1," area and I feel like a lot of that is just changing you know there's a you're all these condoms I got built over here on the West side of Burnet just north of North Loop and like all of that is really changing over here that's where like in a little Longhorn is poodle dog became the Aristocrat love you can be Aristocrat and the Austin Diner / the omelettry used to be there but even that's getting remodel into a voodoo doll and now it's becoming a Voodoo Donuts I think so like all that's really changing and I can say it's it's not as for lack of a better word as runned"
1," the table trees on Airport"

1," your level but that's how you say"
1," it's also really confused because I think about that before but some streets have multiple names depending on where you are like right over here at Lyndale is Kane egg which is also 2222 Allendale west of Burnet but it's K Nagy stubborn and it's 2222 the whole way solenoid Ben White 71 to 90 west of 35 it's 290 East of 35 it's 71 United goes up"
1," who were the roads are just like so confused he can be referred to in multiple ways I fucking hate it it's it's awful it is awful maybe we did one of the first I think we have like one of the members I have moving Austin for today"
1," go to the day actually I went I bought a map like a foldable street map that I like into my bedroom wall so I could like keep track of where I'd been in town in like learning the city cuz obviously for GPS before smartphones I wanted to like get a layout of where everything was a relation everything else and I can't imagine even going anywhere anymore without GPS or even getting around here have you all that information real-time available that makes it so fucking old"
1," to get new maps on an atlas in your you pull out"
1," Happy Days kind of on a place where you can order stuff"

1," place over there by off of Burnet right by Anderson wear Northcross Mall used to be one of you ever been there a place that place is fucking and is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had I got some the other day and on their menu they have one of the types of habits like garlic parmesan fries and says like we're going to get straight to it as the best garlic parmesan fries your head up whatever you know that place is so good and it's just like tucked away in a nondescript strip mall exactly"
1," look over there and I thought it was a Chinese"
1," second Drafthouse Alamo Village"
1," all the way over there and well-acted I thought the story is good for baby little thing was walking through South Lamar It's funny because you bring this up because I was standing there in the that hallway and I stopped for a second cuz I was walking to the theater and I looked around I was trying to remember what it was like for the remodel and I was like oh this is the wall right here where every all of this is me like only that part is here it like I was trying to place it all in my head that part was the original all of us got added just trying to remember that shopping center like where the guitar place and the thunder cloud that was only a scooter ride like how it all laid out what type of wood do you remember"
1," I think there's a tiny little section of the current South Lamar but I'm like this that's our status like this is all that's left from there it's like when you walk in to the South Lamar either you walk past like the bar do you write you turn left to go to the left and the other is a project like this the stuff on the wall to the right around there there's like a double doors are always open everything before the double doors those little wall to the left and right that stilled what was there before and I think everything Beyond those double doors with all but with"
1," then she over there yeah"
1," right parking lot in the front when does secret was always like you can go around behind the Alamo and park behind it the other people didn't know to park back there they were just park in the Big Lot out front so you get a decent spot in the back cuz nobody ever really drove around over there"
1," even at night like you did out of a movie if you just feel that trap heat radiating off of the the parking lot at the store real quick"
1," sync sxsw even though I didn't attend any sxsw film showings I remember I remember they would have showings are going to see any other movie was always a nightmare to the lines were so long in the parking lot with gets so packed I remember just being like upset about and grumbling under my breath I just want to go see a movie"

1," that was a long time ago I thought would have been to like 2,000 for if if memory serves correctly this was before we had right before we had the social website we were still operating like the block style website with PHP BB forms I believe it was just like a sponsor and he said Bernie a message on PHP BB forms I was like a Robert some of the Barenaked Ladies Reno realize what you guys are doing we're going to go"

1," people would like to make post on the forums talking about how they went to like a Barenaked Ladies show at Red Rocks and they were like do you remember"
1," interesting to me you know when all that was happening it was like wow like celebrities like stuff to you like you always see them as like people that you own that only exists on screen or like in on the CD or"
1," on top of everything you know about their interest there's things that they do and definitely in some cases not a role model for I think I'd be real do you were talking we had started talking about businesses that you wanted to visit like it's a celebration of things on this stretch of Burnet I think you wanted to continue the conversation get out there talk about things that we don't love anymore"
1," used to be downtown like at 7th and Congress and we would have walked over to a Torchy's trailer that was on 6th and like West or they're kind of like by Little Woodrow's and Star Bar"
1," what does the first I think it was the first very first or not but I mean that's just part of that kind of growth right it's like you can manage your distribution and suppliers and you know once you grow and have tons of locations that I can you need different distributors different quality control the real issue between location to it's a very different type of business that you're dealing with it that point that being said there are other instances like I think Rudy's managed to keep a very consistent experience no matter what absolute location you go to it like if you no matter where you are I felt like the one over here that open on Lamar with a little iffy at first I was a little rocky when they open but they've sent squash those bugs and now it's like it's on par with all the other Rudy it's not like it's the best barbecue in the world but it could barbecue"

1," scheduling stuff I looked around I didn't see that first class like I look like a fucking creep and I walked out and left to listen I've never been here at 10 in the morning before I used to care like I usually do at 2 p.m. but the difference between"
1," season 2 DVD thinking about the time frame because we had a fulfillment house in season 2"
1," we were going to do a thing where we were going to autograph all of the"
1," 2,000 or 3,000 DVDs whatever it was and then ship them out so instead of paying the Fulfillment house for that we decided just to ship those DVDs straight to your house so we were going to sign them and then they were doing that and they're not getting more like kind of cutting them out and dealing with directly and it's a Bernie had to smooth things over with them and he was mad at us cuz we created this like weird awkward situation for him or we put him in the middle between us and the Fulfillment house I do not remember that but I do not remember that"
1," because they were making so many dumb mistakes at the same time story yeah Eric of our first Christmas with the 4th of my house now our second Christmas with the Fulfillment house oh my God in season 3 of RvB"
1," they said hey we can offer gift-wrapping if you guys want to gift wrapping oh God I forgot about this and I said yeah that sounds like a great to order late if it already comes gift-wrapped it was just ready to throw to the tree so we're like yeah please so we offer that they turned that on the software they offered that as an option and then"
1," package is not arriving package is not arriving package is not arriving eventually I go down to the Fulfillment house to meet with the guys to figure out what's going on and I walk in and I see a pile of Christmas presents wrapped just in the corner like hundreds of RvB DVDs and t-shirts and stuff and I go yeah we've been meaning to we just we ran out of ribbon and I was like how long have you been driven there like it's been taking it it's like"
1," had to apologize to all the customers and because they"
1," for Christmas one time we all had then we all have to go up there I think they like wanted us to go up there they're going to show us something like a some some new things on the service they wanted to offer us we went up there and they had like a big presentation ready for a site like these computers on a table I hated to stay so badly and they're like look we can offer gaming computers that you can sell on your online store and we like well one we don't do that to these look like shit they had no and who was the"
1," they had one behind a piece of red fabric and one buys a piece of blue fabric and they were like they're like the computer blue in this will be red because when you can pick which one"
1," Dexter some real lie detector going off I'll pause for a"
1,"that may be the most out of factory tour had it looked like if your 12 year old cousin Bill the computer for you"
1," well and there's another time we was like weed we can't we can't I mean even if they looked amazing like this doesn't this isn't what we do what I'm going to get to selling computers online and it's"
1," and listen up on these guys and I don't want to because they were wonderful they were really sweet they helped us out in a very precarious time in our growth we eventually had to move away to a larger fulfillment house and then we eventually had to move away to a larger phone now so I could keep this as it goes with growth but for those first three years they were they were integral and they're really sweet people and I haven't seen any of them in years but I remember them fondly and I love them but God damn didn't begin the process of the audience thinking we've"
1," stop and us having to take the blame for other people's fault problems and having to take it on the chin and man is that that doesn't persists to this day"
1," something or somebody doesn't mean that weird we hate that mean we got the whole episode complaining about Frank years of everything went fine story is not very interesting or compelling there's no story"
1," moved and we moved with them longer than three years we stayed with them about a year longer than we wanted to because we were scared they would go out of business"
1," are concerned they were a fulfillment house before us and I assume their fulfillment house after us but it was one of the things we really like them and so we like we hung around a little longer than we should have and then we'd finally did leave they had the contract so we didn't feel like I was going to take them but yeah still at your business or part of somebody's bottom line"
1," people who fulfilled the Lance Armstrong"
1," in a big way and they did and they helped us get they helped us get a couple of rungs up the ladder yeah nothing but fond memories of all the vendors that we work"
1," don't see your view and I'm think about really like you order something online and you know that if you order something like Amazon you really think about how does it actually get to you or was it and put it in the Box who printed the label control of its automated nowadays what it's like very tedious things that need to get done I need to get done correctly with ribbon"
1," if you think about like musicians and tours right like the reason your torso Selmer"
1," first hurdle we would run into any time we met peers like in the industry in those early days was trying to explain to them how like they thought we were crazy for selling T-shirts and stuff and trying to explain why it was such an important part of what we were doing and then blew past if there was a long time when I thought we were the only people that are really awesome but maybe penny arcade"
1," store that would"
1," it would show the inventory likely to be like there are three hundred and thirty-five strong buy T-shirts in stock and so I would in the early Days of Our Lives to be over figuring this stuff out I would go to a job I would go at work in the morning I would print every morning the entirety of their store and then I would go home tonight after work and I would Decker meant how many items I've sold so I could reverse-engineer how much money they were making Merchant day"
1," old"
1," and then I would base our sales and stuff like orders in South based purely upon start"
1," wild to go and it was like to be like 35 pages I was just go Page by Page and print every page from the store and then I go home and write the numbers down. They sold 9 of this action figures today"
1," special 7 t-shirts printed that was a long discussion cuz you can't be like will pay you once and then we made $10,000 if we've ever talked about how many DVDs we've sold but do you know I would no idea now I know that I have"
1," here's a way to play this is the best way I can put it in perspective I have no idea on the hard data but I know that that company that we the company that didn't didn't have ribbon and they tried to get us to sell computers and fucking high-speed gaming mice which we did self I think about that unfortunate timing about a month before we let them go or we switched vendors they gave us a frame plaque they framed 100,000 order and we still have that around the office probably still somewhere I don't know how much we sold. The course of history the company"
1," but I know that we had at least a hundred thousand orders in the first 4 years 3 years"
1," remember this a couple times but before we had the Fulfillment house when I was still living with Jeff you know we get woken up early on the weekend you know there be someone like knocking on the door or ring the doorbell like a persistently not the going away if we go out there and like open it and if you like a dude with a semi and be like where do you want the DVDs maybe I've got a couple pallets of DVDs here or do you want them quit worth of dog is a house dude it's just I don't know drop them in the driveway I guess so if you would just like get his pallet jack and drop like pallets of DVDs and more problems with either we have to like break the pallet down and carry all the DVDs into his garage cuz it that's where was staged to them package everything and ship it out we got these poor guys like driving a semi down the resident"
1," residential streets and then expecting to find a loading dock somewhere I'm in a 7-0 like drop all that shit"
1," and they're"
1," on them now and almost nothing was different people it was so long ago three lifetimes ago hard to even"
1," like I remember them as stories as if I watched it on TV like filling out some dude shows up and he's like yeah I've got like this giant box to Geoff Ramsey like a big box you like this dude you know pulled it out from the semi no dropped it on Jeff's driveway remember Jeff and I was standing out there like we expecting any or we can order anything when I expecting any merch you know what the hell is that mean we're both a little scared cuz we couldn't figure out who was from based on the return address of gingerly opened it look very carefully and it was a giant Halo 2 Master Chief statue like how tall is like 5 ft tall is bungee your Microsoft"
1," the office every now and then somewhere while back down because I felt like when she was first acquired by Microsoft you know you know hit the Halo came out for the original Xbox and we really you know we weren't making reference to the office before Hitler came out but after Hitler came up before Halo 2 came out you know what's going to start making red versus blue and we got to know the people at once you very well at that time we would go up there very frequently I remember specifically one time before Halo 2 would come out like I think they'd only shown the E3 teaser and like nobody had seen anything about the game and they invited us up to play it to Seattle Redmond who was our first office in Millennium Park when they were first acquired by Microsoft terrible you'll see it in like in like"
1," making up halo to docks where you see it all over the place that I moved out after he moved out to the other bigger office has made a very unimpressive office in Kirkland Kirkland up to the to the office in Redmond at Millennium Park and it looks like they set up a couple of TVs in like a spare conference room and it was I want to say it was Jeff Bernie me and maybe Jason yeah maybe Jason we are all he was mad from Norway and it was just like I don't know those dudes were any was like big they locked the six of us in a room and then just watched us"
1," play Halo right there like 1 and objective wanting us to to play it's going to eat and then all the four of us immediately stop playing the game you know where is like trying to see like if we can clear the sequester ourselves I started trying to see like can we still make red versus blue in this what the hell are you guys doing come in I turn turn The 90Â° okay hit the smart okay now can you lower the gun how do we do you know yeah we're doing this and then like this one dude who walk seems like we fix that bug by the way I'll also by the way I'm"
1," one of the one of the Ewok"
1," the one second that we can you put that back in just put that bug. I can just put that back in there like a"
1," not as good as hell for filming for filming the first time when was like holy shit like this is really good despite all you know the screenings and sales and everything like to finally get invited up like this is the game everyone's waiting for and like we got invited up to play it like it was a really big fucking deal it work it was one of those things were like we blew like our personal bucket lists were so small and we just blew through them every month with new opportunity is the same like it all started because we loved video games"
1," bringing our TVs and Xboxes to Bernie's house for an entire weekend and setting up an Xbox Kinect and go through all the rigmarole and we were playing two hour-long games a c t f on Sidewinder down"
1," and it all came from that we had it was just like we were gushing you know the idea that we could even meet the developer for red always been the previous episode I'd always been a huge fan of Bungee the earlier games like I mentioned the dude here in Austin who replied to my email but that trip when we played Halo 2 that was my first time ever going to Seattle I don't know if you've been up there before I remember we landed at night at Sea-Tac and he's ever been to Seattle like SeaTac is right and I remember we landed at the airport there was a car that picked us up it was I would like this weirdo eccentric driver was I go to town car service or whatever we're getting in the back and you know when you leave Seatac to go to Seattle"
1," especially at night you got to drive through the middle of nowhere that's like nothing for a while especially back then it should have been 0-4 it's very dark and I remember being in the back seat and the driver just kept talking and talking about how he had Britney Spears in his car or the week before us partway through the trip he's like oh I'm almost out of gas I need to stop and get gas and then he like pulled off the highway and like"
1," but I was really worried that this guy was about to murder me some Shell station off of the highway was putting gas in it no we drive up and then you don't even really even going to Seattle like we kind of price to Bellevue in Bellevue"
1," I'm not a praying man in that backseat like oh my God please do not let this guy"
1," years what it was"
1," why do trees first experience"
1," that's why this would have been much later we were supposed to just probably eat in the Halo 3 hours we were staying in Kirkland just when she was in that Kirkland office we're staying at a hotel there in Kirkland by the Burgermaster I want to see what is LaQuinta and I don't know if you were on the ship remember this but there was like they called it Like A once-in-a-century storm blew through and it was like so windy and Smith so"
1," and like the hotel we're staying at since like you know use with electronic card readers at work anymore"
1," glow sticks into our hotel room to illuminate the hallway because even the emergency lights weren't working cuz the power was off for so long I presume do the key locks on the door must have a battery in them as well but it was like it was the power's off for so long nothing was working in that hotel at see memories from that trip from that time one was we were eating"
1," lunch at a restaurant and a tree fell down and crushed in cars with a giant tree stroye like a row of cars in the parking lot like a big ass tree and then later that night we were walking around Seattle dickin around joking around about zombies for some reason and I remember Matt kept leaning into the wind and it would like support them it was so windy he'd like his glasses and they just went into the air and they were just they were in Portland in 4 minutes and Matt had to call all of you like can you buy me a new glasses or four of us there we couldn't find them like they didn't hit the ground they went it was a good cartoon they went straight up"
1," we lucked out because I think we all had booked us a weird route I think we were we are flying to North Loop there on American Airlines we're flying Alaska this one time and our flight was out of like that satellite gate like the end the end terminal or whatever or whatever that we journalists and that was the only part of the airport with power so because we are flying Alaska instead of American platoon or lead at the time and because our flight was originated out of that area that was only part of the airport of power we were able to leave like everyone else who had their flights were all canceled because there's no power at the airport actually I spent the weekend with a with a friend of Ruth's teeth alone can't Nichols who"
1," was that one of the two creative minds behind ask a ninja who were huge huge an earlier that yet we're one of the first big deals and we worked with him a lot we actually had a pilot with them for a little while then go anywhere but we were really good friends with Kent and Doug and and and that crew and over the weekend and we were talking about how"
1," in this a twenty-year career the different phases where you're talking about going to Seattle a bunch there was a period where we went to Seattle eight times a year between packs and Angie and then other Microsoft said we were there like $0.06 like we're going to"
1," a year probably but we're going up to Seattle probably like every other month and we were New York every other week there a while and then there was a period when I was in San Francisco during the cheap stuff probably like 6 times a year and then I don't know why I would go back I only reason to the cycle that takes the right now you're going to New York is very important you guys for the next two years and then you will never go there again and then stamps is going to be a big deal then you will go there I don't remember we used to back when we're doing a lot of commercial work going up in Portland at wieden Kennedy like we were going up there so frequently I was in talks with like corporate condo people in Portland yeah we were there so much it's like"
1," so much money we may as well just have a condo right by the Ad Agency because we're always there"
1," down."
1," was one time where we banged out you and I banged out a couple with me and Jason and I didn't care about it was for arena Arena Football"
1," happy with it they were like booked a flight that night to come back to Austin Ouija I remember we just had to tackle some dude over like on the sidelines in the game Ice Arena Football there's a wall over the wall over the wall all morning and then listen to remind me to buy hellofresh you got New Year's goals and hellofresh is here to help you achieve them skip the grocery store take control of your time and budget with delicious recipes delivered right to your door with hello fresh eating one of the New Year can be stress-free and delicious options here looking for to help you achieve your goals and choose calorie smart and carb smart recipes or even customized select Meals by sloppy protein or side I'll bring your protein or adding protein to a veggie dish I'm a big fan of hellofresh I just got the shipment yesterday so matter-of-fact and I made one last night and had a zucchini and tomato flatbread with"

1," talked about 1 when we scream season 2 premiere season premiere of season 2 of Gavin yeah but we know we were good friends with the guy who was the director of the Lincoln Center and he loved programming internet content and so we were up there quite a bit you know doing screenings and various we would make videos for other screen see what have I would do that Incredible Edible internet video was like promoting out of their screening of yeah he moved on to San Francisco and we would do some screens out there like San Francisco film festival and whatnot he died of cancer"
1," it had lived in San Antonio and Austin his entire life and one of them get away so I think it's about 6 months or a year there and run season 2 or 3 where he moved to New York City and the nick his brother moved up with them and then he work for G doing some stuff while I don't know if you remember this but there was a power outage in New York back in 03 for some New York City lost power and Jason was living there at the time and we needed him to do a Tucker line but he couldn't cuz there was no power so there's one Tucker line in season one that's voice by his brother Nick and you'd never know they sound so much alike does one line as Tucker in season one because Jason couldn't do it because there was no power in in New York I think it was like"
1," spend some time going to go to visit G at San Francisco and doing stuff out there but I was referring more to like it. Like"
1," 34 years ago when I was working pretty closely with kind of funny laughing the last play family and then we did that documentary about stand up and so I was up there like"
1," for that way I should just move here because I'm here all the time an independent of that I felt like we also did a lot of work with Ubisoft for quite a while their offices in San Francisco Bay area as well there's a lot of trips that are very forgettable where you go up and you get there on a Wednesday and then you have dinner with the Ad Agency or you know the whatever team of our team that's there and then you get up the next morning and then you go to Ubisoft and you sit in a conference room for two hours and you pick up thing and then you leave and go home like there's countless trips like that and you'll nine times out of ten nothing comes out of the other than that 10 time you end up with a gig and then there's like so so so so so many forgettable trips to New York and San Francisco and La when we did that stuff there's one trip I took to San Francisco by myself to do some Ad Agency work"
1," who's the really weird thing yet and do it like this really small Ad Agency and you're working on all this creative stuff and like the way the office of structures like you walked in there was like one big room Library open Office concept and you know there's like a receptionist receptionist has a bathroom the right behind out was just like this giant rubber no doors or anything until we were all sitting around like doing the kitchen all the creative stuff coming up with all these ideas and one day I really need to take a dump like something was wrong and like I needed to run to the bathroom but he was that one bathroom looking right now it's all it's all open go to be terrible if I go in there and like take monster nasty dump and go to flush it and the toilet won't flush it was like oh my God there's no plunger there's nothing in here I'm going to open the store and"
1," are going to be able to smell it and I can't do anything about it so I'd like to like Open Door very quickly come out and like I said receptionist boots like sitting right there like hey do you have a plunger"
1," I have to go get it for me to go back in to close the door and then fight with him for the next couple of minutes to try to get the toilet to flush"
1," high-rise on the ground floor I wanted to just walk out and leave and never go back I want to do it like the Earth to swallow me up"
1," this is a total aside"
1," plunger"
1," Arab hubcap tied to it for some reason."
1," so full of"
1," that reminds me I don't know why but you talk about jumping on the first floor do you remember when we were doing that press junket of interviews at Comic-Con a few years ago we were interviewing people from like"
1," I don't know what show he was on but he he kept trying to convince us we need to pee out of the second floor of the window"
1," out of the window so I just try it."
1," we went to we were in La do you know why I don't remember P3 3003 I think you and Jason and I got so incredibly drunk"
1," hotel. I've no memory of where it"
1," in the hot tub but it was like"
1," figured out how to break into the hot tub and we did and then we just we didn't have swim trunks everything so we went in the hot tub in our underwear and we were just like all the lights were off we're trying not to get noticed and then we were just kept getting drunker and drunker and then we getting in the hot tub is a great yeah some of these memories are black and we'd dared each other to pee off of the roof and I don't know if I was the only one brave enough to do it or not but it was you and Jason were there as well and we paid off the roof"
1," and then we eventually got kicked out and then I don't know what happened. But I woke up in front of our door at like 5 in the morning in my underwear sleeping in front of the front door we had a photo for a long time back before digital camera we we have taken a photo of him laying their face down in the house"
1," I'm glad"
1," coffee's good you were Ben Affleck coffee on"
1," what that is but the buildings around here in the parking lot later homes"
1," you saw me walk in and walk out is because I was confused I thought you said nothing says little"
1," somebody owns this property and then has"
1," genius but I guess they call a little Fields so that like a Veracruz moves out and somebody moves in a"
1," front door to put screen ordering system"
1," pretty cool cars that are under"
1," so much face work"
1," I'm running the cookbook cookbook is it is turned into a lot of work and it is"
1," but they're not super helpful with"
1," funny thing and I've done a lot of a lot of work he told Tony who runs a lot of"
1," it's been a little while since I've done this and I'm going to need some help"
1," I went to journalism School in the"
1," army Iran I was a section editor of the newspaper I did I laid out the entertainment section of the 4th of Sentinel every day every week for years I did the layout the initial layout and I'm I personally made the first to Archie comic books on Griffin and Luke took over after that and they did a much better job but like"
1," I just haven't used it in 15 years I'm going to send them to do it and I was like does InDesign still exist and then I tried looking him like I do I have any more"
1," but I think I don't know about you I don't speak for you your problem that has plagued me for years even before we reached professional that's a problem where I think I can do something I bought off more than I can chew on and getting over my head and realize oh crap like I can kind of do this but really I need to bring someone in who knows more to either really help me or to do the entire thing is the amount of black man our right to make it look 80% is good when I can just hide when we can just have the professional people to run. I don't know if he's done it and you probably never seen this Eric is used to be back when we would share that big living room office at the Butte apartment anytime I start laughing and come running over to watch Muse Photoshop it was like watching a monkey rubbing two sticks together trying to make fire"
1," if you want me to try to edit an image of the most roundabouts stupid way possible that's another one I used to be so good at Photoshop and so Adept with Photoshop and now I like I'll go in my daughter only work on time for school and all that she'll have fun shopping. What's going on everything that she's doing would have made my life so much easier"
1," Someone visit us once at the Congress office in someone for another internet company who want to come down and see how we were going to be was working with some other content creators online and see what I work process was and he sat in our office in Congress for a week and watch this work watch how we made stuff and how everything got done and we're going Friday he was getting ready to leave he's going to pack your stuff up to go to the airport to get on his flight he packed all the stuff up and before he left before you walk out he was like four of us want to say one thing I don't know how anything gets done here"
1," you like this was this entire week has been baffling to me to watch how you all do not communicate there's no hierarchy I can tell but still somehow everything gets released and everything gets done be like this is this makes no sense to me and then he walked out and went to the airport."
1," Yeah I know if you remember that I don't know who was"
1," that's part of the strength of RoosterTeeth was so much about right place right time right people write but"
1," that there are many weaknesses to starting a business with your friends and I would not recommend it however"
1," such a short hand with each other and cuz we worked together already we're all work at the call center together and a Bernie and Matt and Joel had made movies together so we all had experience working together and we all had just like I think that the real Secret Sauce it was Weird Al just had a very similar drive you know but like I was one of the beauties of doing something like this with people that you're so intimately familiar with is that you you just kind of work in tandem without having to / communicate and we are working together without any communication getting stuff done there was a question"
1," the Bell Catch-22 Victory Records man"
1," to"
1," and I wish you could"
1," It was like like every other Red Sox here I thought it was nothing"
1," might be the best cup of coffee we've had reporting anema"
1," we need to go record a fleet has a hole in the wall coffee shop on Webberville it's across from where Gordmans used to be its next to the"
1," what's that place called shit there's a metal bar over there that shows what is"
1," that up it's connected to the last up to you because the lost well is the bar that the people who ran"
1," that other bar that escapes me that we used to go to all the time and 6th Street that Adam Thompson love lovejoy's it's their it's what they do after lovejoy's"
1," why I'm happy to hear you say that I took I thought it was a bit of a risk to recommend this place T all one because I come here all the time and I really like it and I would hurt my feelings if you guys didn't like it but to it's 90% like nannies with kids running around and I thought that this could be a recipe for"
1," sloped Hill and little kids lose their grip better at the top of the hill when you sit on that little bar and just kind of look at over it and it's just I don't know man it's the vibe here is just awesome like the"
1," us when you want to get away like I hit cool coffee place we talked about this is not a food recall"
1," is that we were on the corner"
1," there's a how Emily are here not too long ago and we parked next to a house that was for lease and so we looked it up the least price on the house $20,000"
1," majan pay over $2,000"
1," a fancy house but it wasn't it wasn't"
1," the river"
1," there's one over there in Mueller's original Wellfleet has coffee has tacos too and they're good yeah but there's a good they're not from Veracruz they're from a different taco truck that's also break and I can't remember what it's called the original Veracruz like on East 7th and I feel like Austin kind of led the charge in the trailer park Eatery thing early on over it have been for many years"
1," Brick + mortar for a while but then like that building got torn down because they're building condos"
1," the name and say it and then somebody said"
1," my wife asked me the other day what it stood for and I told her it was my first time seeing it out loud and I hate it I was like oh it's only existed in my head up until this moment and I said it was like"
1," what did she say"
1," have any"
1," the name again I'm"
1," are we also talked pretty heavily about how we we realize that we were okay and stuff but not great and we turned it over to the professionals are the professional we've turned this over to"
1," so defeated by knowing we had we were nine them so the way there and then you and I put all that work and then we didn't it wasn't even yet"
1," you'll get it'll eventually happen if you had all this work done I was like this"
1," funny"
2," coffee we ordered Fleet coffee and then it's pretty crowded there and so we walked eight feet over to the lost well yeah next door was sitting outside which"
2," released just in the sense that this was the people who used to open used to run the bar that we used to go to a lot with Adam call love joy peace love joy is right they had the best jukebox in Austin back in the day yeah Growler filled with beer there"
2," chick at lunch choice"
2," I was married to my first wife of the time so I was like oh that's right flattering thank you but I'm listen buddy"
2," or in general so I'll just get that out of the way people are"
2," yeah we used to go to lunch with every now and then it was I wouldn't say it was like on our regular rotation to visit"
2," of the west side of the west side of the street north of six"
2," west of BMO this is how I would have described yeah right around there I don't remember what was next to it or what was on six"
2," closed 2009 doesn't years ago maybe a little longer"
2," the french fries that we were in love with from Shaggy Boombastic way back in the day Cavalier which is directly across the street from us is a local bar they have those"
2," heard her husband was her parents that owns"
2," I really good"
2," and then right down the street to the right was Gordmans I don't know if it's still open which is like the best sandwich dive in Austin"
2," that it's a little grocery store on Avenue B over in Hyde Park on Scott lexine it's been open since like the early 1900's under the"
2," do you Remember The Soup Nazi that's what it is like you cannot take your you cannot take pictures in there there's like a it's like a really good friends are glorified shity convenience store it's got like groceries and air quotes you know a couple of things that you might buy but at the back there's like a window you understand what you're saying about like a big board over the window when I go about your kind of sandwiches you can order or you can do your own like and it tells you step one step two meat or cheese to 3 and then we just go down all the different steps forward the dude who makes the sandwiches and runs the place is very particular and you must know what you want and you must order it in the correct way or he's going to yell at you and you had better not commit the Cardinals"
2," and of opening your soda before you pay for throw you out of the store for that around"
2," your first off you gotta have a plan with a plan I want ham lettuce pickles thank you thank you for the side"
2," for the place"
2," five stars visit the sandwich is amazing is the best thing for one star I can't believe he's open there's no in between the $5 one star all I asked for was X and he blew his lid yeah"
2," recipes"
2," when he first moved to Austin he lived across the street from the Avenue B grocery for I don't know what a"
2," know it existed and I would ask him what time you been having to be at me like I know what that is but I would describe the do not go here Samantha runs it is at least a jerk and possibly dangerous or violet"
2," the cold weather. Don't make the soup out of you ever had a soup there"
2," there and eat outside by wouldn't even do that no I don't need cold brew"
2," could miss it it's like it looks like a kind of a dilapidated house but it does have a bunch of I mean like weird like we're Key signs on it and"
2," road from the early 1900's like under like a glass case you can go in and you can see like their order logs from like"
2," door to the window Casino back in the day."
2," what I mean that's that's"
2," intimidating about walking into any place in the back of a place"
2," it's not known you're stepping into something you probably don't belong to your clearly the outside of the second you walk in and you got to figure it out on the Fly"
2," but that being said we definitely should I try to look up Avenue B on y'all to see if there were pictures of the menu online to see if I could buy coffee."
2," Austin not Avenue be that's over in Hyde Park but we're over in Webberville is that there's another bar right down the road,"
2," is on the 1st"
2," designed they have it there with drunk people"
2," in the back"
2," diluted"
2," street that has just a bunch of shit packed into it there's other stuff across the street that I don't even know what it is"
2," spent much time over by for a while as you put it right around the corner but real in reality far away I don't know why I never made it out over here this is Fleet used to be my coffee shop actually but I keep running into Sophie and Nathan and it just always awkward conversation so I stopped"
2," good it just was over here okay it's the only Bagel option within a few miles"
2," a bagel by itself or like what is a 2 bucks"
2," dictionary"
2," they have weird hours during I don't mean to keep pulling it back with your hours became very irregular and they were closed for a long time so I just I don't know if I've been back recently. Since they've resumed their regular hour cuz I would try to swing by right now and then it'll be like clothes clothes and I think even before the pandemic like the owner went on a long vacation and it was just like the closed sign was on for a long time with no explanation then you came back I mean I don't know I got to a point where with the regularly enough where I wasn't scared anymore and I think he was okay I don't remember I wouldn't order one of those sandwiches off the menu I knew I would get like sourdough and ham I don't have"
2," look at it again and I'm sure if I looked at the menu I can tell you exactly how I got it but I can't remember anymore. My head is going to be able to because I was the only substitution I had to make was just no mayonnaise fealty in a minute we should we do we definitely should try to make it a point about their banana pudding"
2," it is a"
2," like my papa thought the crib right there right there not my favorite either not the worst why I spent so many fucking years over here on the East Side in bars and stuff and now I don't come over here at all ever"
2," has borne here and I used to like roll my eyes whenever they would come visit me and be like we lived here back in the seventies there was nothing South Riverside all of this is new and that's a full-circle didn't used to be here to be over there remember that there was briefly to be at least beer there's a Peruvian place right down the road oh that sounds familiar it's in that weird space like around Springdale and 7th yeah I did eat their huge huge can approve you know that huge huge fan"
2," Peruvia file"
2," so have you tried this this food truck out here this lick it up Mexican Street Food plant so long you plant-based the Mist"
2," certain kinds of food Mexican food specifically there's a there's a great plant-based Mexican trailer that now has a broken motor like off of East 12th called Missy this place they have that trailer on East 12th and open up a brick-and-mortar over there like 183 and Burnet so I'm always looking for more tacos nachos burritos are no no nothing nothing at all by myself and"
2," whenever to make 64 guys arrest record me to go into places together but we inevitably we'd run into each other and hang out and spend time together I think nowadays if we were to do that I probably would not be probably like I am going to my room I'm going to watch TV and go to sleep even like when we together and we spent all day together around each other like a rabbit eating coexisting and then at night after dinner it's like 80 and I'm ready for bed and I should be much the same at this point I mean like I don't think I had anything to do with"
2," beach living I just hate is about when I start to"
2," know that you would"
2," beauty of it is that"
2," important part of our jobs and our career and I think we both really instantly saw cuz were the first people to do a convention and I think we had that lightbulb moment where we saw how like the the"
2," I guess you would say what's wrong with enthusiasm would be like so present even other intangible that we I think we both really keyed into how important that part of the the job was for us even though they weren't real moneymakers I bet that we probably broke even or made a little bit of a little bit but you would go and you would do these conventions and then for like the next week you have like 500 kids in high school and red vs blue clothes and talk about how great it was to meet us and stuff and it was great to meet them too and so I didn't realize how important that was to the growth of Rooster Teeth in a very like street team you know door-to-door Conaway"
2," and so we took a lot more seriously than anybody else and we took it as a big part of what we did so we didn't work inventions and because we did that because I think we were so similarly aligned and work ethic and also what we were trying to get out of it we worked very fucking well together so we were like a well-oiled machine and we would get there it was No Nonsense we would put everything into efficiency getting it set up getting is like getting out of the palace torn down everything set up getting ready to sell and then the second we started to sell Gus and I went into B mode where we tried to give every single person that came to the booth 45 seconds of comedy and keep it going we wanted to please everybody give everybody something a little special and then get them out the door so that we could please the next people and then at the end of the day we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible we were pretty burned out from talking to people for 12 hours a day so we didn't want to spend a lot of time"
2," honest with you the way I did a lot of work and"
2," you're probably a little bent out of shape at the people in the booth who didn't work as hard as us and we didn't want to hear poker differently expensive steak dinner on the company with them and so we would go back to the hotel room with account the money or eating pizza and go to bed I don't know if you remember this when you know don't play at a convention when the hall closes there's an announcement like all the clothes proceed to the exit whatever if I stop people like dilly-dallying around or not believing I would start screaming at them from the booth"
2," closed I want to go home I can't leave until you leave you know that you had 10 hours today get the fuck out of the biggest pet peeve. And I would have if somebody would come and they would work the booth"
2," could come by for teachers for an hour and be like look at Ruth's Chris"
2," not did not do this is a long day yeah Chris Martin what"
2," food poisoning at a steakhouse at PAX East went out then you like what's it like a plan. We're going out drinking a bunch of went out a steak dinner had a couple drinks and I went back to my hotel room went to sleep and I woke up like in the middle of the night you know what that feeling we like it something bad they run into the toilet like"
2," throw it all up and then being like a thank God like instant relief I feel better than me like waking up the next morning then play all right got it got to shake it off got to get to work immediately that's a I do not miss that stuff I don't need a man was a rough days"
2," this show is sponsored by better help when you're at your best you can do great things but sometimes life gets you bog down you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not showing up in the way that you want to work with therapist can help you get closer to the best version of you because when you feel empowered you're more prepared to take on everything in life I know I don't know about you but I myself like trying to optimize things get the best most use out of it and why would you think that way about yourself you want to get the most out of you you want to get the best out of you and I think therapy can help you find that help you unlock that potential so and if you're thinking of giving therapy to try better help is a great option if convenient flexible affordable and it's entirely online I love that but still every question are you get match with a licensed therapist and if you want you to switch therapist at any time for no additional charge again totally up to you if you want to live a more empowered life therapy can't get you there cuz it betterhelp.com animated a get 10% off your first month that's better help h e l p.com anima anime"
2," we all know that's done for right betterhelp.com"
2," we did fun stuff we went through every Potter that time in Florida was told that story when he met one time and we wouldn't like what the comedy shows and enjoyed I think it's just that we figured out very quickly that it was more fun to be at home then to be at a convention anywhere and so we wanted to be as efficient as possible so we get the fuck back you know you seen this I've seen this kind of stuff I want to do this anymore but I remember you know early on especially it was always it was all new experience is it was only a wee thing we were a lot more wide-eyed about it you would like to know for example I went to Australia for the first time you know we met someone who was really friendly took us to a ski lodge we went skiing yeah which was a whole thing of this amount Buller I think it's called he's like a four hour drive away from a car with a stranger and drove up the mountain and it's not like 3 days or two days skiing with them we also went to that person to get home"
2," we went to the zoo in Melbourne as the Platypus or not it was the funniest thing in the world to me probably stood outside that building for 15 minutes laughing at it we saw that that giraffe kill a possum yeah that's brutal horrific scene of a giraffe just stomping this possum to definitely ripping and its head with his giant giraffe mouth we we we were at the zoo in Melbourne and we heard were walking around with her like this commotion like people"
2," like a hobo people like like talking loudly and kind of yelling and explaining what's going on with idiots right direction we walk over there in a crowd of people around the draft pain and they're screaming things like someone get help a giraffe kind of by like there was like a rock in the middle of the enclosure and I always look next to the Rock like a little possum it was like trying to hide and was like huddled up next to it on the draft was not letting it go at the traffic like stopping at the Rock trying to get the the possum to get out and I guess it finally at one point the possum decide to try to make a break for it but it's much faster and let started like trying to kick at it and stomp on it while it was running and got like a glancing blow on it what kind of like days the possum and then it like brought down its full weight on yeah and then like I guess the other dress notice what was going"
2," cuz they all like convened on this scene and they all like to put their stupid big necks and heads down and they all started ripping it apart like one of them like lifted it up to like its full height and then dropped it down to the ground and it was brutal little kids started crying at parents were shielding their children's eyes and looks full grown adult with a tears streaming down their face like someone do something well usually the night it was brutal it was really gross it was amazing"
2," DraftKings be mean they're big and seeing it you know move around I know it's a bad racket"
2," I bet Gus I bet I've been to Pike's Place Market was Gus more than anybody else on purpose,"
2," in New York"
2," it's it's been a great experience even before my old job I used to do a lot of traveling it was a it was a traveling job I was 5 days out of the week on the road and my days off for Tuesday and Wednesday we spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Austin and then Thursday through Monday I was going some to some town somewhere that's been a lot of time"
2," I took that other job before we speak because I thought I've never really traveled this is a traveling job like it to see so much stuff but you don't realize unless you've ever had a traveling job if you see a lot of airports in Hotel Airport you see the hotel and that's about you see the thing I remember is convention center carpet that every city I got dinner for carpet carpet carpet"
2," be at the booth 3 hours before opening to set up and do all the work and then I need a racing around town one of those rates around town trying to find a bank open to get change for the day has sucked worse and run reports and then selling and being on all day and then cleaning up then go back and tell him I would love to do it if I don't have to do all the other stuff that's what it is you have to worry about all the other logistics and everything where's our packages from the dog or"
2," is when you see what I was thinking about RTX you know which is our event here in Austin wondering if we're doing"
2," for that but doing this on are you saying like doing this on the road somewhere"
2," is that we've been to enough cities in enough of these events that we could only find something local to latch onto to tell stories about I think so yeah that would be interesting to remember once we were still open or not but I remember one time we were on a trip out at Bungie when they were still in Kirkland at the the the old Pancake House Office"
2," and we were staying at a hotel down the street and one morning I was walking over to to to that Bunch you off this week to work on something was walking with Matt and it was like a second or third day there and I put it out cuz I don't know if you were there or not but there was a kind of across the street down to wait a little bit from that Bunch the office there was a pay-what-you-want coffee shop he was like a coffee shop in the order whatever you want and it was like a box with a lock on it it's like whatever you felt like putting in the box to put in there as an exchange for the coffee fix dinner menu but there's no set prices was like whatever you wanted to pay you put the money into the box that's cool and I was feeling bad about it so I kind of the day before I go again what you want coffee place like you go in you know or do whatever you want and put cash in this box with a lock on it he's like I want to go there too. You know cross the street stopping at the coffee place I walk in first Matt walked in behind me that walks and takes one step and loudly as"
2," we employ you like to send it on that all the same time to explain it was a pay what you want coffee"
2," barista"
2," think it's just a difference between working a convention for 15 years and attending conventions you know there's a different Beast"
2," but I was I like I would love to I love performing you know so there was a reason for us to perform anywhere I would do"
2," to like podcast savings and stuff"
2," that store that we stopped before we finish cuz we're losing so much money and losing money"
2," we're already going to a convention not that that's something we really do anymore but I"
2," should re-evaluate conventions in the way we approach them I think doing in the way we did in the past doesn't make sense but I think having a presence and showing up to do events at like you're talking about that conventions at other convention makes total sense why we stepped away from that has valuable I remember why we were just burned out and we"
2," we only had there's only so many hours in the day and we had to be more purposeful with where we put our man out that but you know we don't have they don't all have to be the time since that they were before I like all that huge time investment to get being spun up and going again"
2," hang out like what kind of like what we did at VidCon this"
2," we've say for the next day if there's another panel to Q&A or something bright these days I'm not big on traveling for work. There's so much stuff to get done here and I'll see if I can show up go do something for a day like and then fly back the next day or fly back the same date that's ideal that's great I'm not I don't want to give like a big going to go there"
2," two or three days like I'm coming behind of things cuz then sit here falling behind schedule just it's just a whole ordeal"
2," I ate it's funny you said that though because I have been thinking a lot about this podcast going forward and just I mean I think they said I have luckily 25 years or something of stories to tell but there will come a point when we run out but it's become apparent to me that"
2," United really interact much the last couple years because we don't have a production together and we're both permits and if I was telling Erica the day I need to find a way for this podcast to continue to outlive our our old stories because otherwise not seeing each other it was the only way our friendship flourishes / up workout to roll it into whatever the next thing is"
2," I got I don't know I'm outside. So there was this other idea I had for a different podcast I do you know I got my pilot license last year and I discovered I have this other podcast black box down the covers Aviation disasters and I discovered that there's an airport that is the airport code is BBD kind of in the middle of nowhere in that velvet door it's kind of in the middle of nowhere it's about an hour-and-a-half flight from here maybe a 2-hour flight from here to small-town I thought about organizing a fly in event for black box down there was like one morning I fly out there and I'd land and I wait and see if anybody else shows up if there's like any other pilot to listen who would show up at the airport in the middle of nowhere with your for 3 hours and it take off and leave is the most Niche idea 11 weird Corky"
2," I like that kind of stuff that's a really off-the-wall ideas I love crazy impractical"
2," I'm always drawn to the idea of doing interviews and I think that a fun direction to go with this podcast has it if that's what I did take it on the road the other cities we do have like an episode in certain cities but it would be just as much fun to go to like a city and then interview somebody from that city of some prominence are Providence a remote and then"
2," and learning about the city through their stories"
2," like when we do and I thought I personally find interview content to be very interesting and engaging but I feel like we ever Russia doesn't the audience doesn't"
2," see exactly what I was thinking about going to counter that Jeff is that we still have plenty of people here locally that we haven't had on that we talked about having our stories years from now and get to know it's something we have to confront in 2023 or 2024 I just the idle mind wanders and I start looking down the road and just me."
2," I like"
2," my efforts and my creativity in my work and where I wanna put it yeah and I don't want this to get lost in the"
2," it is genuinely it seems like a lark at first but it's become a pretty valuable part of my week this podcast is one of the reasons that I am also very restricted in my job I want to make sure that like 4 or 4 works. I want to make sure that I'm here on these days so that we can we can record like this one and Black Ops I want to talk about it like I want to I don't want to get behind on bills I want to make sure that that were"
2," podcast exist so in that we talked about him we need it"
2," first and then think"
2," sleeve am I Americana was almost as big as the Cup itself suggests that if we were to come here which also try the best news of coffee with because of the trailer right"
2," I will say for my money"
2," come here after dropping off from school every day to get a cup of coffee I'm not going to lie I thought this"
2," about"
2," right before we started I have easily said every word in the title"
2," sometimes I repeat the word to like emphasize that what I'm saying not every time but sometimes I do to try to get you to ask why you saying that and nobody"
2," trying to shoehorn I'm like I'm afraid that what I'm saying like they're going to clearly know that I'm I'm saying something here cuz I'm saying makes no sense to obviously so it's not"
2," the last week or the week before and I said it out loud and I hated it"
2," are outside I never told her that's awesome"
2," talking"
2," the whole names of MacGuffin"
2," M that's very true but no"
2," got to say I never got the appeal of all-inclusive until I went to Cancun with Eric and his voice in a way it"
2," the shot"
2," got you locked down"
2," is this the free food place"
2," opportunity or anytime just"
2," weird that's the other thing"
2," thoughts that listen that's why don't I just don't like promoting stuff for that reason it's if if they're going to give your word to give the war up and I'll happily take it but I'm not going to promote it because you never know what's going on I'm not saying anything happened I'm just saying it's weird"
2," Drive-Thru"
2," and yeah"
2," for everything immediately that's why I always I always say if you set the bar of expectations low enough it's impossible to trip over"
2," my life and I do not trust I feel I think about I don't know why but this is not even a very good movie but I think about him all the time in the Drive-Thru is too was house for"
